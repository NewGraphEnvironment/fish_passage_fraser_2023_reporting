# Background

## Project Location

simpcw watersheds with 2023 assessments:
- upper fraser river (UFRA)
- Morkill River (MORK)

## Upper Fraser River

The Fraser River flows nearly 1400km from the Rocky Mountains of Mount Robson Provincial Park to the Straight of Georgia near Vancouver and is the largest salmon-producing river on Canada's west coast [@bradford_taylor2023Diversityfreshwater]. The river is economically significant due to its role in supporting forestry, agriculture, and hydroelectric power generation. Additionally, the Upper Fraser River is crucial for fisheries, particularly for salmon populations, which are vital to both the local ecosystem and indigenous communities. NEED INFO ABOUT FN IN AREA.

The Upper Fraser River is commonly defined as the section of mainstem north of Quenel, which flows through the Cariboo and Fraser Plateau regions. Major tributaries include the Nechako, Quesnel, and McGregor rivers [@shaw_tuominenWaterQuality].
The seasonal hydrograph has a single broad peak in early summer due to snow and glacial melt from surrounding mountain ranges. NEED TO GET HYDAT STATION

## Morkill River


## Nechako River

The Nechako River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of `r fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(356362759) %>% mutate(area_km2 = round(area_ha/100, 1)) %>% mutate(area_km2 = ifelse(area_km2 >= 1000, format(area_km2, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE), area_km2)) %>% pull(area_km2)` km^2^. Beginning at the Nechako Plateau, it flows north towards Fort Fraser then east to its confluence with the Fraser River in Prince George. The Nachako River has three main tributaries: the Stuart River, the Endako River, and the Chilako River. It has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08JC001")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08JC001 located in Vanderhoof and `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08JC002")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08JC002 located in Isle Pierre, \~25km downstream of the Stuart River confluence. Flow patterns at Isle Pierre are heavily influenced by inflows from the Stuart River (enters downstream of Vanderhoof) resulting in higher peak levels and average discharge (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrology-plots) - \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats2)). The hygrograph at station 08JC001 in Vanderhoof peaks in June and August, with lower peak levels and average discharge (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrology-plots) - \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats1)).

```


## Endako River

The Endako River is a 6th order stream that flows south east from Burns Lake to Fraser Lake. It drains an area of `r fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(356361442) %>% mutate(area_km2 = round(area_ha/100, 1)) %>% mutate(area_km2 = ifelse(area_km2 >= 1000, format(area_km2, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE), area_km2)) %>% pull(area_km2)` km^2^. There is one hydrometric station on the Endako River located in Endako, but it was only active for one year during 1951. Given the one year of data, the mean annual discharge is `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08JB004")$LTMAD,1)` m^3^/s at station 08JB004. The hydrograph peaks in May-June (Figure \@ref(fig:hydrograph1)).

knitr::include_graphics("fig/hydrograph_08JB004.png")
```


## Chilako River

The Chilako River is a 6th order stream that flows north from the Nechako Plateau to the Nechako River. It drains an area of `r fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(356363121) %>% mutate(area_km2 = round(area_ha/100, 1)) %>% mutate(area_km2 = ifelse(area_km2 >= 1000, format(area_km2, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE), area_km2)) %>% pull(area_km2)` km^2^. There is one hydrometric station on the Chilako River located ~10km upstream of the mouth, but it was only active from 1960-1974. Given this data, the hydrograph peaks in May-June (Figures \@ref(fig:hydrograph2) - \@ref(fig:hydrology-stats4)).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lfpr_create_hydrograph("08JC005")
