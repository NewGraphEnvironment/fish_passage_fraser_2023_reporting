# ## Dakelh
# 
# The Dakelh (Carrier) people are indigenous to north-central British Columbia, with a deep connection to the region's waterways. Their name, Dakelh, translates to "people who travel by water," reflecting their reliance on rivers such as the Lhtakoh (Fraser), Nechakoh (Nechako), and Nak'alkoh (Stuart) for transportation, trade, and sustenance [@hudson2010Dakelhcarrier]. 
# 
# <br>
# 
# The Dakelh were key participants in the Grease Trails, trading inland goods for coastal eulachon oil [@hudson2010Dakelhcarrier]. Their Athabaskan language, Dakelh, has declined due to colonial policies, but revitalization efforts are ongoing. Organizations like the [Yinka Dene Language Institute](https://www.ydli.org/) work to document and promote Dakelh through education, literacy programs, and linguistic research [@yinkadenelanguageinstitute2025]. The Lheidli T'enneh First Nation and local school districts have also developed language programs to preserve and teach Dakelh (@Ourlanguage2025).
# 
# <br>
# 
# The Dakelh people traditionally organize their lands into Keyohs, family-run territories passed down through generations. Each Keyoh is overseen by a Keyohwhudachun (Keyoh Holder), who manages land use and stewardship [@Keyohhuwunline2025]. Despite historical disruptions, Keyohs remain central to Dakelh identity and land management practices.
# 
# 
# ### Lheidli T’enneh
# 
# The Lheidli T'enneh First Nations are a Dakelh sub-group whose traditional territory encompasses the Nechakoh (Nechako) River, Lhtakoh (Fraser) River, and Morkill River, and spans from west of Lheidli (Prince George) to Valemount. "Lheidli" translates to "The People from the Confluence of the River," referring to the meeting of the Nechako ("Nee Incha Koh" – "river with strong undercurrents") and Fraser ("Ltha Koh" – "Big Mouth River") rivers in what is now Prince George, British Columbia [@Ourstory2025]. 
# 
# <br>
# 
# Located within the traditional territory of the Lheidli T’enneh is Chun T’oh Whudujut (Ancient Forest), a Provincial Park and Protected Area 120km east of Prince George. The park has thousand-year-old western red cedars and a rich biodiversity of plants, mosses, lichens and fungi which can be explored through the trail network. Historically, Lheidli people would visit the stands from summer fishing camps along the upper Fraser River as well as gather medicinal plants, some of which were thought to be extinct. However, the park was not always a protected area and was initially slated for logging until a UNBC graduate student studying lichen biodiversity identified the ancient stands of western red cedars. Recognizing their ecological and cultural significance, trails were developed to highlight the cedars and advocate for their protection. Through partnerships with local hiking groups, UNBC, Lheidli T’enneh, and the Provincial Government, the Ancient Forest biodiversity assessment project has contributed to conservation efforts and tourism-based economic development in the Prince George area [@Chuntohwhudujutancientforest2025].
# 
# <br>
# 
# ### Carrier Sekani
# 
# The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council unifies six nations west of Lheidli (Prince George) whose traditional territories include the Lhtakoh (Fraser), Nechakoh (Nechako), Tsalakoh (Chilako), Endako, and Nadleh (Nautley) Rivers [@CSTCCSFNs]. The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council includes:
# 
#   - Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation - located near Burns Lake 
#   - Nadleh Whut’en First Nation - located near Fraser Lake 
#   - Saik’uz First Nation - located near Vanderhoof
#   - Stellat’en First Nation - located near Fraser Lake
#   - Takla Nation - located near Takla Lake
#   - Wet’suwet’en First Nation - located west of Burns Lake
# 
# <br>
# 
# ### Nazko
# 
# Nazko, meaning "river flowing from the south," is a Dakelh sub-group located 120 km west of Quesnel along the Nazko River. Originally known for its strong ranching history, the community expanded into forestry in the 1980s, establishing Nazko Logging, a successful enterprise that created jobs and supported economic growth [@adams_stokes2025Historynazko].
# 
# <br>
# 
# ## Simpcw
# 
# Simpcw, which translates to "People of the Rivers", is one of the 17 campfires (bands) that make up the Secwepemc, or Shuwap Nation. Their traditional territory stretches from north of McBride, south to Barrier, and east to Mt.Robson Provincial Park, and includes the North Thompson River and the Upper Fraser River [@UsSimpcw]. 
# 
# <br>
```



## Lhtakoh

Known as the Lhtakoh, meaning "rivers within one another" to the Dakelh (Carrier) people, the Fraser River stretches nearly 1,400 kilometers from the Rocky Mountains of Mount Robson Provincial Park to the Strait of Georgia near Vancouver. As the largest salmon-producing river on Canada's west coast [@bradford_taylor2023Diversityfreshwater; @DaklehPlacenames], it plays a crucial economic role in supporting forestry, agriculture, and hydroelectric power generation. Additionally, the Fraser River is vital for fisheries, especially for salmon populations, which are essential to both the local ecosystem and indigenous communities.

<br>

The Upper Fraser River is commonly defined as the section of the mainstem north of Quesnel, flowing through the Cariboo and Fraser Plateau regions. Major tributaries include the Nechako, Quesnel, and McGregor rivers [@shaw_tuominenWaterQuality]. This vast expanse supports many indigenous groups who utilize the land for cultural, spiritual, and economic practices. 

<br>

The Upper Fraser River, an 8th order stream, drains an area of 232,134km^2^ upstream of the McGregor River confluence. The seasonal hydrograph has a single broad peak in early summer due to snow and glacial melt from surrounding mountain ranges (Figure \@ref(fig:hydrograph-fraser)). The mean annual discharge at station 08KA005 in McBride, located roughly 200km southeast of Prince George, is `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08KA005")$LTMAD,1)`m^3^/s

```


The Nechako River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 47,269km^2^. Beginning at the Nechako Plateau, it flows north toward Fort Fraser, then east to its confluence with the Fraser River in Prince George. The Nechako River has three main tributaries: the Stuart River, the Endako River, and the Chilako River. It has a mean annual discharge of `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08JC002")$LTMAD,1)`m^3^/s at station 08JC002, located near Isle Pierre, approximately 25km downstream of the Stuart River confluence. Upstream at station 08JC001 in Vanderhoof, the mean annual discharge is `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08JC001")$LTMAD,1)`m^3^/s. Flow at Isle Pierre is strongly influenced by inflows from the Stuart River, resulting in higher peak levels and average discharge (Figure \@ref(fig:hydrograph-isl-pier)). In contrast, the hydrograph at Vanderhoof shows lower peak levels and mean flows, with peaks occurring in June and August (Figure \@ref(fig:hydrograph-vanderhoof)).


<br>

The Nechako River, meaning "Blackwater people's river", is home to the Cheslatta Carrier Nation who are part of the Dakelh people. Traditionally, they lived off the land near Tsetl'adak Bunk'ut "Peak Rock Lake" (Cheslatta Lake), however, in 1952, the construction of the Kenney Dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (now Rio Tinto Alcan) and the subsequent flooding of the Nechako Reservoir forced the Cheslatta Carrier people to abandon their ancestral lands [@HistoryCheslattaCarrierNation; @DaklehPlacenames]. This relocation was done with little notice or compensation, causing significant disruptions to their community, culture, and way of life. Despite these challenges, the Cheslatta Carrier Nation has worked to preserve their cultural heritage and advocate for their rights and land restoration.

## Endako River
The Endako River is a 6th order stream that flows southeast from Burns Lake to Fraser Lake, draining an area of 5,970km^2^. One hydrometric station (08JB004) was located in Endako but was only active during 1951. The mean annual discharge for that year was `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08JB004")$LTMAD,1)`m^3^/s, with the hydrograph peaking in May–June.



## 	Tsalakoh
The Chilako River, known as Tsalakoh by the Dakelh people, translates to "beaver paw river". It is a 6th order stream that flows north from the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Nechako River, draining an area of 3,634km^2^.  One hydrometric station (08JC005) is located approximately 10km upstream of the confluence with the Nechako River; however, it was only active from 1960 to 1974. During this period, the mean annual discharge was `r round(fasstr::calc_longterm_mean(station_number = "08JC005")$LTMAD,1)`m^3^/s, with peak flows typically occurring in May–June (Figure \@ref(fig:hydrograph-chilako)).

## Fisheries

The Fraser River watershed is the largest salmon-producing river system in British Columbia and one of the most significant on the Pacific Coast. It provides critical habitat for anadromous salmonids, resident freshwater species, and other aquatic organisms. The river supports indigenous, commercial, and recreational fisheries, with Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) playing a key ecological and economic role.

<br>

The 2019 Big Bar landslide created a significant barrier to salmon migration in the Fraser River, further stressing already vulnerable populations. Extensive mitigation efforts, including rock removal and the construction of a fishway, have helped improve passage, with an estimated 2.9 million salmon successfully navigating the site in 2022. The Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance (UFFCA) has played a key role in supporting emergency response and recovery planning, working with federal and provincial agencies to ensure First Nations' interests and traditional knowledge are incorporated into long-term recovery strategies. This includes ongoing monitoring, habitat restoration, and collaborative management to mitigate future risks to Fraser salmon populations [@Upperfraserfisheriesconservationalliance].

### Lhtakoh  

The Fraser River mainstem serves as the primary migration corridor for all anadromous fish species returning to spawn in its tributaries. Historically, the Fraser supported some of the largest sockeye and chinook salmon runs in North America. However, climate change, habitat degradation, and fisheries pressures have led to declining salmon populations in recent decades.  

<br>

Upper Fraser sockeye populations have been in decline for several decades, likely due to reduced flows and altered water temperatures, affecting migration and spawning success [@levy_nicklin2018ChinookSockeye]. The Early Stuart and Late Stuart sockeye are now classified as "Endangered" by COSEWIC [@cosewic2017COSEWICassessment]. Under the Wild Salmon Policy, several Upper Fraser sockeye conservation units have been classified as "red-zoned" [@levy_nicklin2018ChinookSockeye]. 

<br>

In 2005, @nesbit_etal2005Valemountarea outlined key fisheries areas in the upper Fraser River watershed as the McLennan River, Swift Creek, and the upper mainstem of the Fraser River near Valemount and Tête Jaune Cache. These systems are known to support chinook salmon, with documented spawning in both Swift Creek and the McLennan River. At the time of reporting by @nesbit_etal2005Valemountarea, two Wildlife Habitat Areas (WHA 3155 and WHA 6012) were designated in the Tête Jaune Cache area based on high fisheries values. WHA 3155 encompassed the confluence of the McLennan and Fraser Rivers and was recognized as the largest chinook spawning area in the upper Fraser system. WHA 6012 protected an adjacent side channel further downstream, which was identified as important juvenile rearing and refuge habitat during high flow events. Although both WHAs have since been removed, their prior designation underscores the ecological importance of the area.

<br>

Swift Creek is the site of ongoing conservation hatchery efforts by the Spruce City Wildlife Association (SCWA), which has operated a volunteer-run hatchery since 1987. Following upgrades in 2020, it is now considered the most technologically advanced hatchery in the province. Focused on restoring upper Fraser River chinook, which are listed as "Endangered" by COSEWIC [@cosewic2019COSEWICassessment], SCWA releases thousands of chinook fry into Swift Creek each spring as part of broader recovery initiatives targeting key spawning systems in the region [@sprucecitywildlifeassociation2023SCWAHatchery].

<br>

Three sub-watersheds within the upper Fraser River basin are designated as Fisheries Sensitive Watersheds (FSWs) due to the presence of sensitive fish species, including chinook salmon and bull trout. The Goat River and Milk River watersheds have held FSW status since 2013 [@flnrord2004Orderfisheries], and the Walker Creek watershed has been designated since 2004 [@flnrord2004Orderfisheriesa].

<br>

The importance of salmon in the upper Fraser is strongly reflected in Valemount’s community identity, education, and ecotourism initiatives. Public engagement with the salmon run is encouraged through accessible viewing areas at George Hicks Regional Park on Swift Creek, the Fraser River at Tête Jaune Cache, and along the McLennan River—locations that serve both as local gathering points and platforms for increasing awareness of salmon life cycles and watershed stewardship [@tourismvalemountSpotSalmon].

<!-- Need more detail and references -->
<!-- Fraser River salmon populations are monitored through escapement surveys and hydroacoustic assessments. Some key salmon populations include: -->

<!-- - Early Stuart and Late Stuart sockeye: Historically large runs but now at risk due to changing freshwater and marine conditions. -->
<!-- - Upper Fraser Chinook: Many stocks are designated as threatened or endangered under SARA. -->
<!-- - Pink Salmon: Typically return in odd-numbered years, with variable escapement trends. -->


### Nechakoh

The Nechako River, a tributary of the Fraser River, supports Chinook salmon populations and serves as a migration corridor for sockeye salmon that spawn in the Stuart and Nadina/Francois Basins. Since the construction of the Kenney Dam in the 1950s, flows in the Nechako River have been regulated by Rio Tinto Alcan for hydroelectric power generation at the Kemano Generating Station on the Pacific Coast. In response to concerns over impacts on Nechako Chinook and Upper Fraser sockeye, flow management practices have been implemented. Since 1987, the Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program (NFCP) has operated an annual monitoring program, focussed on Nechako Chinook and migratory sockeye salmon designed to monitor the effectiveness of conservation measures specified in the 1987 Settlement Agreement between Canada, British Columbia, and Alcan [@levy_nicklin2018ChinookSockeye].

<br>

The Nechako River also supports a genetically distinct and endangered population of white sturgeon with low natural recruitment. To address this decline, the [Nechako White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative](https://www.nechakowhitesturgeon.org/) (NWSRI) was established, implementing conservation measures such as the Nechako White Sturgeon Conservation Centre. The facility focuses on conservation aquaculture to maintain genetic diversity and support population recovery. Since 2006, the NWSRI has been releasing tagged juvenile sturgeon annually into the Nechako River to aid in species restoration [@NechakoWhiteSturgeonRecoveryInitiativeHome].

<br>

Indigenous fisheries organizations, including individual First Nations, the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council, and the Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance (UFFCA), are actively involved in fisheries management in the Nechako watershed. These organizations work to support conservation while ensuring the sustainability of Indigenous fisheries, which have cultural and subsistence importance [@Upperfraserfisheriesconservationalliance].



### François Lake  

François Lake is one of the largest natural lakes in BC and supports landlocked Kokanee (O. nerka), as well as migratory sockeye salmon that access the lake via the Stellako River. François Lake is a key rearing area for juvenile salmon before migrating to the Fraser River.  


### Morkill River  

The Morkill River, a tributary to the upper Fraser, supports populations of bull trout, mountain whitefish, and rainbow trout. While salmon presence in the system is limited, the Morkill provides cold water inputs to the Fraser River, which may offer thermal refuge for migrating salmonids during warm summer months.


### Salmon Stock Assessment Data

Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data was accessed via the [NuSEDS-New Salmon Escapement Database System](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/c48669a3-045b-400d-b730-48aafe8c5ee6)

### Fish Species

Summary of historical fish observations in the Upper Fraser River, Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, and François Lake watershed groups (Table \@ref(tab:fiss-species-table)) [@moe2024KnownBC].

<br>

A review of available fisheries data, for the Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, François Lake, Morkill River and Upper Fraser River watershed groups, stratified by different habitat characteristics can provide insight into which habitats may provide the highest intrinsic value for fish species based on the number of fish captured in those habitats in past assessment work (Figures \@ref(fig:fish-plot-grad) - \@ref(fig:fish-plot-width) - \@ref(fig:fish-plot-wshed)).  It should be noted however that it should not be assumed that all habitat types have been sampled in a non-biased fashion or that particular sites selected do not have a disproportionate influence on the overall dataset composition (ie. fish salvage sites are often located adjacent to construction sites which are more commonly located near lower gradient stream reaches).
