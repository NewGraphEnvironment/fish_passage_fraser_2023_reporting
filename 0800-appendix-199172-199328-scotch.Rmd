## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 8km northwest of the Nadleh Whut'en First Nations community, on the northern side of Fraser Lake, BC. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located 230m upstream of Fraser Lake, on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1790947 and 3365573). Approximately 270m upstream, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1794199). Both crossings are within the Francois Lake watershed group. 


## Background {.unnumbered}

At the crossing location, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-199328)).

<br>

In 2023, crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` were assessed with fish passage assessments. These sites were prioritized for follow-up with habitat confirmation assessments due to the presence of high-value habitat observed upstream during the 2023 assessment.

<!-- Upstream of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. -->

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)`  {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was embedded, 100% backwatered, and ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-199328)).

<br>

PSCIS crossing  `r as.character(my_site2)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-199172)). This culvert had a significant 1.35m outlet drop, likely inhibiting fish passage. 

<br>

In 2024, a third crossing (PSCIS 203297) was assessed on a private road, approximately ~140m upstream Stella Road. Two pipes, 0.6m and 0.45m in diameter, were present and the larger culvert had a significant 0.7m outlet drop. The inlet side of the road had completely eroded into the stream, obstructing the view of the inlet. The heavily overgrown and collapsing road appeared to be private access and would be a good candidate for removal. LINK TO APPENDIX 1. 

<br>

At all crossings, the water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199328-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199328-d01))."))`. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value. The stream had been channelized with riprap at the upstream end of the survey and near the downstream lake. On the lakeside, the left bank was a mix of forest and recreational property lawns. A historic Chinook point was recorded near the culvert at Gala Bay Road. Some type of bloom was observed along the lake shoreline `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199328-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199328-d01))."))`. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')`.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` upstream to crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)`, a distance of approximately 270m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199172-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199172-d01)"))` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value with limited pools, however abundant overhanging vegetation and small woody debris provided cover and gravels suitable for resident salmonid spawning were present. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds')` Incision was evident, beginning with a deep cut at the culvert outlet under Stella Road and continuing downstream to Gala Bay Road. The riparian area was generally intact throughout most of the stream, except for the downstream 75m, where private land development on the north side had resulted in a lawn and riparian vegetation removal up to the channel edge. A historic Chinook point near Gala Bay Road may have resulted from a past salvage operation.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199172-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199172-d01))."))` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value with abundant functional large woody debris creating occasional pools 20–30mm deep, suitable for overwintering juvenile fish. Overhead cover was extensive, and occasional gravels were suitable for spawning. Approximately 400m upstream of Stella Road, the stream transitioned to a beaver-impounded area with four consecutive 1–1.5m high dams holding back a large volume of water, but flow over or under allowed possible fish passage. The impounded area extended as far as the surveyed area. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` A fish (~40mm) was observed after the second beaver dam. PSCIS crossing 203297 was located 150m upstream of Stella Road on private property, where the culvert had a significant outlet drop and severe erosion, creating a fish passage barrier.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

A the time of reporting in 2025, crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol and no remediation is required [@moe2011Fieldassessment]. 

<br>

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m span) is recommended. This culvert had a 1.35m outlet drop, very likely inhibiting fish passage. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2), big.mark = ',')`.
