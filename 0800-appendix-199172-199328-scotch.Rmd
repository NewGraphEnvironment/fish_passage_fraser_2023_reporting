## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` which flows into the northern side of Fraser Lake, BC,  approximately 8km northwest of the Nadleh Whut'en First Nations community, in the Francois Lake watershed group (Figure \@ref(fig:map-199328)). Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located 230m upstream of Fraser Lake, on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (`chris_culvert_id`: 1790947 and 3365573). A further 270m upstream, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (`chris_culvert_id`: 1794199).

## Background {.unnumbered}

At the location of these crossings, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the lower crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-199328)).

<br>

In 2023, both crossings were assessed with fish passage assessments and prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat and a chinook observation from 2018 documented adjacent to crossing `r as.character(my_site)` in the FISS database [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. A habitat confirmation assessment encompassing both crossings was conducted in 2024. Downstream in Fraser Lake, white sturgeon, chinook, bull trout, rainbow trout, kokanee, and other species have been previously recorded [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC].

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)`  {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was embedded, 100% backwatered, and ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-199328)).

<br>

Further upstream, PSCIS crossing  `r as.character(my_site2)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-199172)). This culvert had a significant 1.35m outlet drop. 

<br>

In 2024, a third crossing (PSCIS 203297) was assessed on a private road approximately 150m upstream of Stella Road, with results provided in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-203297). Two pipes were present, with the larger culvert having a significant 0.7m outlet drop. The inlet side of the road had completely eroded into the stream, obscuring the inlet from view. The road was heavily overgrown, collapsing, and appeared to be unused. 


<br>

At all crossings, the water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199328-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199328-d01))."))`  The stream was small, low-gradient, and gravel-dominated, with habitat rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') |> stringr::str_to_lower()` value for spawning and rearing. Channelization with riprap was present near the upstream end of the survey and again near the mouth at Fraser Lake. A possible algal bloom was observed along the lake shoreline `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199328-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199328-d01))."))` `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')`

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed from `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`  upstream to `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)`, a distance of approximately 270m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199172-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199172-d01))"))` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds') |> stringr::str_to_lower()` value, with limited pools; however, abundant overhanging vegetation and small woody debris provided cover, and gravels suitable for resident salmonid spawning were present. Incision was evident, beginning with a deep cut at the culvert outlet under Stella Road and continuing downstream to Gala Bay Road. The riparian area was generally intact through most of the survey, except for the downstream 75m, where private land development on the north side had resulted in a lawn and riparian vegetation removal up to the channel edge. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'ds')`

<br>


## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199172-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199172-d01))."))` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us') |> stringr::str_to_lower()` value, with abundant functional large woody debris creating pools 20–30cm deep, suitable for overwintering juvenile fish. Overhead cover was extensive, and occasional gravels were suitable for spawning. Approximately 400m upstream of Stella Road, the stream transitioned into a beaver-impounded area with four consecutive dams (1–1.5m high) impounding a large volume of water. Flow was maintained over or under the dams and the impounded area extended to the upper end of the surveyed area. A fish (~40mm) was observed after the second dam. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us')` 

<br>

PSCIS crossing 203297 was located approximately 150m upstream of Stella Road on a private road, where the culvert had a significant outlet drop, severe erosion at the inlet, and the road was collapsing.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

A the time of reporting in 2025, crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol and no remediation is required [@moe2011Fieldassessment]. 

<br>

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed upstream, replacement of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` crossing (`r as.character(my_site2)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m span) is recommended. This culvert had a 1.35m outlet drop, very likely inhibiting fish passage. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(site = my_site2), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>

Further upstream, PSCIS crossing 203297 was located on a private road that appeared unused and was collapsing. With a 0.7m outlet drop, the site is a strong candidate for deactivation or removal. Follow-up engagement with the landowners is recommended to assess interest in restoration or road deactivation.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a small stream that flows into Fraser Lake, with a documented chinook observation from 2018 near the outflow into the lake [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. The downstream crossing on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was ranked as passable; however, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` had a significant 1.35m outlet drop and presented a clear barrier to upstream fish passage. Fish sampling is recommended to determine whether fish are able to ascend past the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` crossing. The crossing is a `r stringr::str_to_lower(fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, col_pull = priority))` priority for replacement. A further 150m upstream of Stella Road, PSCIS crossing 203297 was an additional barrier to fish passage, with a 0.7m outlet drop and severe erosion obstructing the inlet. The road was heavily overgrown and collapsing, appeared to be unused, and would be a strong candidate for deactivation and removal.
