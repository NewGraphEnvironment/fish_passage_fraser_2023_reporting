## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 45km northwest of McBride, BC, in the Morkill River watershed group.  (Figure \@ref(fig:map-199237)). The crossing is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of where `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` joins the Fraser River. The crossing is situated on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (`chris_hwy_structure_road_id`: `r fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = form_pscis_2024, col_pull = moti_chris_culvert_id, site = my_site)`).

## Background {.unnumbered}

At PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a high elevation watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-199237)).

<br>

In 2023, crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`  was assessed with a fish passage assessment and was prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat and historical salmon observations documented downstream in the FISS database [@moe2024KnownBC]. A habitat confirmation assessment was subsequently conducted in 2024. 

<br>

Upstream of `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. Additionally, there is Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data available for `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` presented in Table \@ref(tab:stock-assess-dat-all) of the background section. 

<br>

A summary of habitat modelling outputs for the crossing are presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-199237).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-199237)). The culvert had a significant 0.65m outlet drop. Photos from the 2024 assessment were limited due to the surveyor’s phone falling in the river; however, photos from the 2023 assessment can be found in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("[Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos]")}else(knitr::asis_output("[Attachment - Phase 1 Data and Photos](#attach-pdf-phase1-dat)"))`.


<br>

The water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`. The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` No photos were available due to the surveyor’s phone falling in the river.

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`, following the west fork at the junction `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199237-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199237-d01))."))` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')`

<br>

The east fork of `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` was surveyed upstream for 230m `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199237-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199237-d01))."))` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us2') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us2')`
 
 <br>


## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` crossing with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>


## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on Highway 16 had a significant outlet drop and is a `r stringr::str_to_lower(fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority))` priority for replacement. Downstream of Highway 16, chinook have historically spawned at the confluence of Snowshoe Creek and the Fraser River [@salmonwatershedsprogram2025Spawnerabundance], indicating this stream has provided valuable spawning habitat. Given that the habitat upstream of Highway 16 was rated as high value for spawning and rearing during the 2024 assessment, fish sampling is recommended to further assess whether the crossing is inhibiting fish passage.
