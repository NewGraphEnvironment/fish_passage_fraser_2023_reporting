## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 76km east of Prince George, BC. The crossing is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of Sugarbowl Creek, which flows into Kenneth Creek before joining the Fraser River. From the confluence of `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` and Sugarbowl Creek, it is approximately 2km downstream to the Fraser River. The crossing is situated on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` and is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (`chris_culvert_id`: 1992815). The crossing is within the Morkill River watershed group. 

<br>


## Background {.unnumbered}

At the crossing location, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a high elevation watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-199260)).

<br>

In 2023, crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`  was assessed with a fish passage assessment and prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat. A habitat confirmation assessment was subsequently conducted in 2024. 

<br>

Approximately 4.5km downstream of the crossing, near the confluence of Kenneth Creek and the Fraser River, chinook and bull trout have previously been recorded [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC]. At this same location, chinook spawners have been historically documented in the [Pacific Salmon Explorer](https://www.salmonexplorer.ca/) [@salmonwatershedsprogram2025Spawnerabundance].  

<br>

This crossing is located within the Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Provincial Park, which protects a significant area of old-growth interior cedar-hemlock forest. The park provides high-quality habitat for wildlife, including grizzly bear, marten, and caribou, and serves as an important movement corridor for caribou. Additionally, the area features a trail system that supports popular alpine backcountry recreation opportunities near Prince George [@SugarbowlGrizzlyPark].

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-199260)). The culvert had a significant 1.4m outlet drop. 

<br>

The water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199260-01)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199260-d01))."))` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds') |> stringr::str_to_lower()` value, with gravels suitable for spawning and occasional pools ranging from 0.2–0.4m deep providing overwintering habitat. The stream flowed through a healthy, mature old-growth forest. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')`

## Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199260-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-199260-d01))."))` The habitat was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') |>stringr::str_to_lower()` value, and appeared suitable for large bull trout spawning and rearing. The stream was a larger, steeper system with intact, mature coniferous cedar-hemlock riparian cover, primarily stable banks, and abundant large woody debris throughout. A step-pool morphology was present, characterized by pools up to 80cm deep and debris jam steps ranging from 30–60cm. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')`

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` had a substantial 1.4m outlet drop and is a `r stringr::str_to_lower(fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority))` priority for replacement. Average gradients were generally above the maximum thresholds for chinook spawning and rearing (4.5% and 5.5%, respectively), suggesting the stream is unlikely to support chinook but falls within the suitable range for bull trout spawning and rearing (5.5% and 10.5%, respectively). The habitat upstream was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us') |> stringr::str_to_lower()` value for bull trout spawning and rearing, with `bcfishpass` modeling indicating ~900m of potential bull trout rearing habitat upstream of the crossing. Given the crossings location within Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Provincial Park and the park's ecological significance, restoration efforts could align with broader conservation initiatives and public engagement, increasing the likelihood of funding and project momentum.
