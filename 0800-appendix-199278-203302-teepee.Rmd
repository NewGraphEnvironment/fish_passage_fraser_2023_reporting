## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)` are located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, which flows into the McLennan River approximately 7km north of Valemount, BC. Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of the McLennan River, on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id:`r fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = form_pscis_2024, col_pull = moti_chris_culvert_id, site = my_site)`). Approximately 300m upstream, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on and is the responsibility of the CN Railway. Both crossings are within the Upper Fraser River watershed group. 


## Background {.unnumbered}

At this location, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream and drains a high elevation watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-199278)).

<br>

In 2023, crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was assessed with a fish passage assessments. This site was prioritized for follow-up with habitat confirmation assessments due to the presence of high-value habitat observed upstream during the 2023 assessment. Upstream of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously been recorded [@norris2024smnorrisbcfishobs; @moe2024KnownBC].

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)`  {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-199278)). The culvert had a moderate 0.4m outlet drop.

<br>

PSCIS crossing  `r as.character(my_site2)` on the CN `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site2)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-203302)). This culvert had a significant 0.75m outlet drop. 

<br>

In 2024, two other nearby PSCIS crossings were reassessed on Teepee Creek [LINK_APPENDIX_1]. Approximately 700m downstream of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, PSCIS crossing 7620 was located on the CN Railway. Although the crossing ranked was as barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment], the culvert was embedded, 100% backwatered, and was not a barrier to fish passage at the time of the survey.  

<br>

Approximately 600m downstream of PSCIS crossing  `r as.character(my_site2)` on the CN Railway, PSCIS crossing 4931 was located on Mount Tinsley Pit Road, which falls under the road tenure of	Carrier Lumber R13564. The culvert had a significant 1.3m outlet drop. 


<br>

At all crossings, the water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info( col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.
