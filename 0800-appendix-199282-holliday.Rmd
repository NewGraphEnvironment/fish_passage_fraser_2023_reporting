## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 23km southeast of McBride, BC. The crossing is located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km upstream of the Fraser River, on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)`, which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: `r fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = form_pscis_2024, col_pull = moti_chris_culvert_id, site = my_site)`). The crossing is within the Upper Fraser River watershed group. 

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At the crossing location, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a large, glaciated,
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() |>english::ordinal()` order stream that drains a high elevation watershed of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The watershed ranges in elevation from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-199282)).

<br>

In 2023, crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was assessed with fish passage assessments and prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat and a historical chinook salmon observation recorded downstream in the FISS database [@moe2024KnownBC]. A habitat confirmation assessment was subsequently conducted in 2024.

<br>

In 2004, chinook and bull trout were captured upstream and downstream of the crossing by Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd. [@manson2005Fishcollection]. Chinook spawners have been documented at the confluence of Holliday Creek and the Fraser River in the [Pacific Salmon Explorer](https://www.salmonexplorer.ca/), with 26 spawners observed in 2022 [@salmonwatershedsprogram2025Spawnerabundance]. 

<br>

Upstream of this crossing is the Holliday Creek Arch Protected Area, a small, 395-hectare protected area showcasing a 80 m wide and 18 m high natural stone arch, which can be accessed via a trail from Highway 16 [@HollidayCreekArchProtectedArea]. 

<br>

A summary of habitat modelling outputs for the crossing are presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-199282).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name, site = my_site)` was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) |>stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-199282)). The culvert had a significant 0.8m outlet drop and was undersized for the stream. 

<br>

The water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')` uS/cm.

Occasional large woody debris features created deep pools, with pockets of gravels suitable for spawning. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')`

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` crossing (`r as.character(my_site)`) with a bridge (`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)` m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at \$ `r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')`.

<br>


## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Chinook and bull trout were captured both upstream and downstream of the crossing in 2004, indicating this stream provides valuable fish habitat [@manson2005Fishcollection]. Habitat modeling from bcfishpass identified 3.3km of potential chinook rearing habitat and 9km of potential bull trout spawning habitat upstream of the crossing, with no other barriers identified upstream of Highway 16.

<br>

Given the documented species presence and available habitat upstream, fish sampling is recommended to assess whether the 0.8m outlet drop is impeding fish passage. With the Holliday Creek Arch Protected Area upstream attracting visitors, crossing replacement could gain momentum as part of broader conservation and recreational initiatives [@HollidayCreekArchProtectedArea].
