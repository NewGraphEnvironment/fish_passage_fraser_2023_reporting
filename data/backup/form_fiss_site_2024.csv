Approximately 100m before the end of the site, the stream showed signs of a large disturbance event that had incised the channel to a depth of 1.2–2m, with major areas of aggregation where the channel was widened and uniform.  Substrates were embedded, with very rare areas of unembedded gravels. Due to heavy rain in the days prior to the survey, conditions were slightly turbid, making it difficult to assess the full extent of gravels, particularly within the tailouts of plunge pools.
