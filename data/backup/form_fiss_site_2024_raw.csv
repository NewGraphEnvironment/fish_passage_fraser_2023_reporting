Lots of gravel present for spawning. Lots of beaver action with signs of old Beaver dams and culvert on settlement Road is has Beaver dams in both the culverts. Bottom end of the site has been in trenched with a machine to form, a huge back watered pool/trench with water pipes going in. Stream follows the side of a cup block so perhaps water pipes were used for the cup block or. Lots of junk lying around the           trench. Very invasive. Stream keeps flowing out of the entrenched area nicely. but has been greatly narrowed. One small fish at approximately 40 mm in length observed. The stream has super nice fish habitat. First 150 m of the stream show signs of cattle trampoline and lots of little trails crossing the stream. The whole east side of the stream runs along the side of a cup block with 30-50m of buffer zone.

Midsize steeper cobble boulder step pool stream that is fairly in size with only very rare pockets of unembedded gravels. Some deep pools associated with boulder and large Woody debris scour. Salmon point noted near pipeline location in FISS. Numerous small steps from 30 to 60 cm throughout due to Steeper bold nature of the stream.
