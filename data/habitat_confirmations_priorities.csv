Burnt Cabin Creek ,199171_ds,199171,ds,,2024-10-03T22:07:29Z,LS,50,Medium,High,"The stream was surveyed for ~50m from Gala Bay Road downstream to Fraser Lake and was a small stream flowing through private property. It was highly channelized with minimal cover and few pools suitable for fish, but gravels were present for spawning. A small bridge crossed the creek approximately 30m downstream of the culvert. The culvert on Gala Bay Road had a significant outlet drop and a heavily eroded outlet pool, indicating it was undersized for the stream. An adjacent landowner reported observing adult sockeye along the shoreline near the confluence of the stream and Fraser Lake in previous years. They also said the stream is reported to flow year-round, even in dry conditions, fed by a spring at the headwaters. ",2301,

Scotch Creek,199172_ds,199172,ds,,2024-10-04T17:07:15Z,AI,270,Medium,High,"A small stream with good flow. Incision was evident, beginning with a deep cut at the culvert outlet under Stella Road and continuing downstream to Gala Bay Road. Abundant gravels suitable for resident salmonid spawning were present. Pools were limited, but overhanging vegetation and small woody debris provided cover. The riparian area was generally intact throughout most of the stream, except for the downstream 75m, where private land development on the north side had resulted in a lawn and riparian vegetation removal up to the channel edge. A historic Chinook point near Gala Bay Road may have resulted from a past salvage operation.

Scotch Creek ,199172_us,199172,us,,2024-10-04T16:43:27Z,LS,550,Medium,High,"The stream provided excellent habitat, with abundant functional large woody debris creating occasional pools 20–30mm deep, suitable for overwintering juvenile fish. Overhead cover was extensive, and occasional gravels were suitable for spawning. A small, broken plastic pipe was present in the first 150m upstream of the culvert, likely a former water intake for adjacent properties. PSCIS crossing 203297 was located 150m upstream of Stella Road on private property, where the culvert had a significant outlet drop, creating a likely fish passage barrier. Approximately 400m upstream, the stream transitioned to a beaver-impounded area with four consecutive 1–1.5m high dams holding back a large volume of water, but flow over or under allowed possible fish passage. The impoundment area extended as far as the surveyed area. A fish (~40mm) was observed after the second beaver dam. The top of the site was marked at WP 400.",1645,

Tributary To Nechako River,199173_us,199173,us,,2024-09-15T19:59:10Z,AI LS ,575,Medium,High,"Heavy cattle impacts were observed throughout the surveyed area, with the most pronounced damage in low-gradient sections with easily accessible banks. The stream changed character at a beaver dam located approximately 300–350m upstream, transitioning from a channelized stream to beaver-impounded wetland areas. A fence intended to restrict cattle access had been breached. A series of beaver dams began approximately 300m upstream of the road, with over three dams observed, some up to 1.5m high. The dams were mature, well-developed, and had vegetation growing through them. Fish were observed throughout the survey area. The habitat was of medium value for rearing rainbow trout and potentially chinook, with some pockets of gravels present. However, heavy cattle impacts had led to significant sedimentation, with fines covering much of the substrate. The beaver dams were impounding large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow downstream at the Dog Creek Road crossing. Waypoints were taken for a breached fence line (WP 32), a slumped historic road (WP 33), and the first beaver dam (WP 34).

Approximately 250m downstream of Sutherland Road, several large consecutive mature beaver dams were present and appeared to continue as far as could be seen. Signs of cattle trampling were observed throughout the stream. The channel frequently split into several smaller channels, making it difficult to follow. Overall, habitat was of medium value, with few gravels for spawning but abundant pools created by the beaver dams. ",4182,SP

The stream had been heavily impacted by cattle throughout the surveyed area, with evidence of bank trampling and extensive low-gradient muddy sections. Upstream of the culvert, the stream was primarily dry for the first 300m, with young forest and shrubs. At this point, intermittent pools began to appear, associated with beaver activity. At approximately 450–500m upstream, the stream became almost entirely watered, with pools up to 40cm deep.

The stream appeared to experience extremely high flows at certain times of the year, as indicated by large eroding banks and significant log jams. At the lower end of the site, the channel was only 3–4m wide, but evidence suggested the stream sometimes occupied a 20–30m width (see photos). A bridge and ford crossed the stream. The site would be a good candidate for follow-up electrofishing. A large pile of riprap was placed at the outlet, possibly to reduce the outlet drop, though its placement appeared unusual and could inhibit fish passage.

At approximately 200m upstream of the highway, adjacent to a quarry, the stream was fully dewatered to the top of the site. The channel was highly confined and lacked complexity. Although some small and large woody debris were present, they did not appear to function in creating habitat during periods of flow.

Gravels were abundant and suitable for spawning. Significant beaver activity was observed, with signs of old beaver dams and active dams blocking both culverts on Settlement Road. At the lower end of the site, the stream had been artificially entrenched with machinery, forming a large backwatered pool or trench with water pipes leading in. The purpose of the pipes was unclear, but they may have been related to the adjacent cut block. The area contained scattered debris and appeared heavily disturbed. Despite the modifications, the stream continued to flow out of the entrenched area but had been significantly narrowed. One small fish (~40mm) was observed. The stream provided excellent fish habitat overall. The first 150m showed signs of cattle trampling, with numerous small trails crossing the stream. The east side of the stream ran along a cut block with a 30–50m buffer zone.

The stream was somewhat channelized due to residences on both sides. Pools were limited, with only two observed that were suitable for overwintering fish, both formed by functional large woody debris. Overall, functional large woody debris was sparse. Banks on both sides showed significant erosion, and the property on river right upstream had reinforced the bank with wood and metal. Concrete was frequently observed in the stream. Directly below the outlet, efforts had been made to backwater the culvert using large boulders in rows, which was somewhat effective, though the culvert itself remained unbackwatered. Fish habitat was limited due to the lack of pools. The river was highly turbid during the survey, so gravels were likely present but not visible.

Pools were infrequent, primarily located on outside bends and behind large woody debris. Some evidence of anthropogenic manipulation was observed, including cut cottonwood trees that had fallen into the channel. The riparian zone was in good condition, with mature shrub communities and old-growth cottonwood that should contribute to future habitat complexity. The culvert appeared to have been modified in the past to attempt backwatering, with boulder lines present downstream. Heavy rainfall over the previous evening and preceding weeks had raised water levels to moderate conditions. The stream was a major tributary to the Chilako River, with documented Chinook presence. The watershed was within Prince George city limits, presenting opportunities for community engagement, trail network development, educational programs, and stewardship initiatives.
