5400442,"This is two 1.55 m pipes plus a 0.6 m overflow.  The north large pipe has a strange apron on the inlet.  The stream is deeply incised (2.5 m deep) within an agricultural field on the downstream side.  No riparian for approximately 70 m downstream on the right bank.  The stream is partially dewatered with stagnant pools throughout.  Forgie Creek dam, owned by Hart George F/V B,  is upstream and may be influencing flow.  Channel is choked downstream with grasses in many places indicating flow is not occurring year around.      "
24707052,"Was modelled as open bottom structure,  has now been changed to CBS.  Larger drainage with agricultural fields both upstream and downstream.  Heavily impacted riparian with primarily field on either side upstream and downstream.  Channel choked out with agronomic grasses.  Mostly dewatered except for intermittent stagnant pools.  Unassessed railway crossing downstream.          "
5400216,Dry at time of survey.  Abundant gravels throughout.  Crossing on railway downstream still unassessed.  Modelled crossing below.  First 5 m of pipe is rusted through on the bottom side.  Deeply incised banks upstream indicate the stream has a lot of flow at sometimes in the year with a decent amount of power. 9m falls ~1km upstream.Upstream Co-op Lake stocked with KO from 2017-2023 and EB from 1963-2023.
5400121,Small stream with very good flow immediately adjacent to the mainstem of the Endako River.  Could be valuable Chinook rearing area during high flow periods.  Pipe is bent in the middle so top half is backwatered but the bottom half is not.  Small outlet drop.  There is a large lump in the road at the pipe and pylons have been set up here likely to warn drivers.
5400192,"Dry at time of survey.  Stream may be channelized upstream due to driveways to private properties on either side of the stream.  Appears to have narrow,  but decently healthy cottonwood dominated riparian,  which could help dissipate flows and floods and runoff.  Crack in Highway at culvert with minor erosion of road prism on downstream side.  Stream labelled as Ross creek on sign.           "
5400235,Dry with very poorly defined channel upstream and downstream.  Seems very unlikely that this system could support fish.  Pipe is rusted right through at the inlet for ~1m.  Pipe is in very bad shape. 
5400045,"Dry at time of survey.  Upstream channel is choked with reed canary grass.  Downstream is extremely thick willow with multiple channels present.  Stream provides access to Drywilliam lake.  Road fill was measured at 12m,  but changed to 9.9 to satisfy provincial submission requirements.              "
5400003, Small drainage. Dry with primarily vegetated channel indicating does not much flow for most of the year. Culvert rusting at inlet. 
5400202,Very nice stream with good flow and abundant gravels upstream and downstream. Landowner indicated sockeye spotted along shoreline years ago. Massive outlet drop. Deserves habitat confirmation and consideration for replacement if no natural barriers upstream. There is a PSCIS assessed site (assessment_id = 7622) upstream that is a barrier.         
5400203,"Very nice little stream with excellent flow for this time of year on a dry year. Crossing downstream on Gala Bay Road was fully embedded and passible at the time of the assessment. There is a historic chinook observation within this stream. This could be valuable Chinook rearing habitat and connectivity within the system should be restored, should no natural barriers be observed on a habitat confirmation assessment.           "
15600277,"Very nice stream with excellent flow for this time of year on a dry year.  Very large deep outlet pool with extensive erosion undercutting the main pipe and 0.6 m overflow. Locally known as Dog Creek. Chinook captured upstream and downstream of Dog Creek FSR in 2021, 2022, and 2023 reported here https://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/acat/public/viewReport.do?reportId=62942.  Connected to the Nechako River with observed chinook points downstream adjacent to the confluence. Road edge is failing at the culvert and eroding into stream. Highly degraded site upstream that would be a good candidate for restoration.      "
15604478,"Extreme negative impacts due to cattle, particularly upstream of the FSR. Extensive trampling of the channel and banks, along with heavy grazing and removal of riparian. Dry at the time of assessment besides a small wallowing hole upstream of the inlet. Riparian exclusion fencing is required along with repairing vegetation, restoration irrigation, and monitoring. This is a fish bearing stream with high habitat values less than 2 km down the stream where it crosses Dog Creek Road."
9903437,Two pipes at 0.6 m each. Agricultural field downstream. Appears that the stream has been modified to put the stream in the ditch of the agricultural field. Aird lake upstream with rainbow trout presence. Dry channel. Very small stream. Massive outlet drops. May have historically provided some rearing refuge for wetted periods of the year.           
9901826,"Dry at tme of assessment. One assessed crossing on private driveway located downstream. Stream is completely trampled and barely recognizable upstream due to cattle trampling and riparian removal. Downstream is ditch like with just grass and shrub riparian before mix forest begins proximately 40 m downstream of the road. Agricultural field on right back downstream. Some scouring of the channel downstream, but primarily choked with grasses indicating stream does not flow for much of the year lately.  "
9903963,Dry at time of assessment. Two other crossings located upstream on non-active forestry roads. Extensive beaver activity upstream with water above both upstream crossings. Could consider opportunity for upgrading this crossing and removing the upper two.

5400227,"Very long culvert length and high fill depth, two pipes. Mostly dewatered stream. Small pools upstream, stagnant water. Small, confined channel. Can't see the other end of pipe, culvert slope estimated. Might be some blockage or culvert is bent in middle. Unassessed railway crossing just downstream."
5400286,"Small fry spotted in culvert and in outlet pool. Two pipes, both old and corroded with large outlet drops. Small holes in both pipes causing some water to flow under pipe.

15600626,"Dewatered stream. Upstream is in fenced off private land, no clear channel visible. More obvious channel downstream of crossing. Moderate outlet drop with big dry area that looks like it would be an outlet pool when the stream is flowing."
15600076,"Two pipes, they are closer together at outlet compared to inlet so they must be bent in middle. Dewatered. Fenced off private land downstream. Little riparian and evidence of cattle trampling. Upstream is in better shape, small channel visible. "
15600629,Dewatered. Fenced off private field upstream. Wide open grassy floodplain with little riparian and no channel visible. Downstream has wide area at outlet where pool used to be. Evidence of livestock trampling and/or big game near outlet. 
15600057,"Culvert runs under active highway construction site. Inlet could not be accessed. Looks like they are excavating near inlet. Possible bridge construction? Stream is mostly dewatered but there is some stagnant water in culvert. Baffles in pipe. Habitat downstream looks good, with abundant woody debris and healthy riparian. "
15603872,"Numerous baffles in pipe. Smaller secondary culvert next to main pipe but installed higher up so likely doesn't get much water. Little amount of flow in pipe but stops just short of outlet, most likely due to small split in pipe. Wide shallow outlet pool but no drop. Abundant algae on stream substrate upstream. RB and WSU confirmed up and downstream. "
9902601,Dewatered upstream and downstream. Baffle steps in culvert containing pools with water but no flow. Efforts being made upstream to restore riparian vegetation with fencing and saplings present. No clear channel downstream. Fish confirmed upstream in 2020.  
9903105,"2 pipes. Wetland area upstream, beaver grate on inlet. Signs of beaver activity, dam near outlet. Hard to determine stream channel width so used combined culvert diameter.

13900100, High value spawning and rearing habitat upstream.  Massive outlet pool with erosion indicates culvert is extremely under sized.   Candy et al 2002 notes chinoook spawning in this system.  
13900026,"Small stream, overgrown with vegetation in sections. Pipe is made of plastic. Some gravels present,  with moderate flow. Unassessed rail crossing just upstream that appears passable. Downstream crossings on private property."
13905537,"Three pipes at 0.9 m each, but only one has flowing water,  other two are blocked by vegetation. Made of concrete and built in 1930. Nice stream with good flow. Abundant rearing habitat located upstream.  Although the stream has a lot of volume, the depth in the one pipe functioning is extremely shallow and has a 50cm concrete drop at the outlet.  This road is the only access to the town of Penny just downstream, therefore a wash out could leave them stranded."
13900027,"Two 0.9m pipes, both plastic. Nice stream with good flow. There is another culvert located downstream on the driveway to a private residence that has a small outlet drop (approximately 20cm). Some gravel is upstream of the railway.  No barrel photos. Penny Street is the only vehicle access to and from the community of Penny located just up the road."
13905538,"Two pipes made of concrete under the railway 0.9 m each. Crossing constructed in 1934. Nice stream good flow. Some small gravel's located upstream. Wire mesh cages attached to inlets upstream - poentially for beaver. Fill depth measured at 12m, but changed to 9.9 to satisfy submission template macros."
13900309,"Predominantly fine substrate downstream but abundant gravels upstream as. Wide channel with good flow immediately adjacent to Fraser mainstem. Small debris jam near outlet, backwatering pipe.  Does not appear to be a barrier to adults but could have value for juvenile rearing and potentially hindered access during high flow times when refuge needed.  Sampling could help determine if chinook are accessing upstream. Very deep, muddy outlet pool.  Unassessed railway crossing ~900m upstream."
13900306,Wetland area upstream. Beaver exclusion cage on inlet but the cage is completely blocked with material so there is a wetland upstream. Appears to be recent maintenance on the site. Road prism is eroding at the location of the culvert with a piece of pipe set aside that has possibly been recently removed.    Culvert slope estimated as could not see through the pipe. Unassessed railway crossing ~1.3km upstream.
13900305,"Stream dry the time assessment. Flows through agricultural field on both sides. Very minimal willow and cottonwood riparian. Stream is incorrectly mapped in the Freshwater Atlas and actually crosses under the road ~350m further east on Penny road.  Satellite imagery shows there are signs of the old meandering channel near the FWA streamline, suggesting the stream may have been redirected at one point.Road embankment is sloughing around the inlet with pipe 50% blocked due to the road fill. Penny Road is the only access to the community of Penny."
13903451,"Small debris jam at outlet causing drop. Culvert is old and warped. Velocity is much higher in pipe than upstream. Predominantly fine substrate upstream, some gravels downstream."
13903452, Very nice stream with abundant gravels and good flow upstream. Some old growth cedar within the upstream riparian area. Culvert must be bent in the middle because cannot see through. Pipe gradient estimated. Large outlet drop and deep outlet pool indicates culvert is extremely undersized.   Penny Road is only access in and out of the community of Penny.  Unassessed railway crossing ~300m upstream.
13903450,"Beaver grate at inlet, moderate outlet drop and pool. Wetland type habitat upstream. Very turbid stream water."
13903449,Good flow. Small channel with fine substrate. Pipe is bent up approximately 2m downstream of the inlet. Debris guard has been built around the inlet.  Penny Road is the only access in and out of the community of Penny.   Is 500m downstream to the fraser river confluence. with another crossing that should be considered.
2023100301,"Stream not present at this location within freshwater atlas. Good flow and abundant, small gravels upstream and downstream. Although pipe appears undersized, the size and depth of the outlet pool indicates that it handles the flow decently well.           "
13900052,Small channel with no outlet drop or pool. Moderate flow and a lot of grassy vegetation on stream banks downstream. 
13905581,"Grassy vegetation upstream and downstream, little to no riparian. Runs through private property downstream. Small channel with low flow."

13903446,Concrete pipe. Smaller stream with some flow. Chinook observations upstream and downstream of this crossing in FISS.   Located on Upper Fraser Road which is only access to communities beyond including town of Penny.        
13900043,Chinook confirmed upstream in 2018. Structure goes under highway and railway. Culvert visible at inlet but outlet has different structure. Slope estimated. Small step at outlet creating drop.  
13903617,"The crossing is actually located ~150m south of the modelled crossing (at km 31.9), on an unmapped Freshwater Atlas stream which flows into the crossing from the east, flowing along the ditch for approximately 60-70m. The streamline can be seen in satellite imagery. Very nice stream with good flow, abundant gravels, and some pools to 50cm deep. The inlet is completely buried and the outlet is blocked by beaver debris. Culvert slope estimated."
13903184,"Very wide stream with high flow. Velocity is high in culvert. Very deep and big outlet pool, depth estimated. Known salmon spawning location. Chinook confirmed with carcass noted just upstream in 2022 by same field team. "
13903183,Wetland type habitat upstream with multiple small channels threaded through it. Inlet of pipe is extremely bent. Nice little stream with well defined channel downstream. Good amount of flow and connected to known chinook system.           
13900192,Very big outlet drop. Gravels present upstream that could be suitable for spawning. Small debris jam ~15m upstream of crossing but likely not a major barrier. 
13900261,"Very nice stream with steeper cobble boulder habitat, potentially valuable rearing for Bulltrout . Very steep and long pipe with transmission line vegetation cleared at outlet.  There's a 20m section of dewatered stream approximately 10m downstream of the outlet due to a graded substrate likely related to highway corridor.  Crossing is within provincial park.  "
13900260,Large stream with abundant gravels present upstream suitable for spawning. Massive outlet drop with powerline riparian cleared downstream of the highway.   Old growth cedar hemlock riparian within Sugar bowl grizzly den provincial park. Follow up with habitat confirmation recommended.                 
13900270,"Culvert very old. Big wetland complex upstream. Inlet barely visible, covered in woody debris and rusty metal. Culvert slope estimated. High velocity coming out of outlet with moderate drop. Habitat looks good downstream, wide channel with high flow. Crossing is within the Sugarbowl grizzly den provincial park. "
13900196,"Very large, low gradient stream with chinook points. Hydrometric station upstream. Outlet drop is comprised of boulders, likely placed there to aid in passage. Located at the downstream end of powerline corridor, there is a steep cascade section for approximately 30m that is 8% gradient.  Cascade could be as much or more of a passage issue as the pipe.      "
13900198,"Massive outlet drop and deep pool,  both depths estimated. Signs of beaver activity near inlet. There is an old well-like structure attached to inlet side.Water could be flowing through underneath surface, not visible.  "
13903179,"Horsetail and willow wetland upstream with a small well-defined channel with fine gradients. Pipe is blocked by beaver debris. There is a second pipe that's approximately 1.5 m higher and 0.9m in diameter that is free of debris and functions as an overflow. Potential refuge area during periods of high flow in the Fraser river,  which was only 40m downstream at the time of assessment.  Gate at the end of the road preventing access to launch point for Penny.  Could consider road deactivation as a solution.  Crossing is located in the Ancient Forest/Chun T'oh Whudujut Protected Area.        "
13900053, Could not locate pipe as it is underwater at both inlet and outlet. There appears to be a bunch of logs under the road so suspect that there may be no structure at all as the drainage may have been put in with logs - although MOT culvert layer says 0.6 m galvanized pipe.. Road is failing with 3 foot deep and 2 foot wide hole in the road marked with a pilon.           
13900201,"Big beaver dam near inlet of culvert spanning across whole channel approx 1.2m high.  Boulders in pipe near inlet creating small drop and increasing velocity.  Channel widens downstream, high value habitat. RB and CCG confirmed upstream and downstream with chinook observed way downstream at mouth.    Low gradient upstream and downsteram with decent outlet drop so resampling to determine chinook presence could be insightful."
13900157,"Very large system with beaver complex upstream, including a large beaver dam approximately 1.3m high located 25m upstream of the inlet. Approximately 20m downstream of the outlet is a rock chiute that is over 30% gradient but only for 5m with a total height of 1.7m.  There are two other falls noted as FISS obstables between this crossing and the fraser river doenstream. There is significant erosion of the road prism on the upstream side above the culvert. Culvert is located on the bend of Highway 16 under 10m of road fill.  Noted falls and lack of fish observations indicated access issues downstream."
13900019,"Steep waterfall 10m downstream of crossing,  approximately 8m in height. Stream gradient and channel width taken upstream. Gravels present upstream, but definite barrier downstream.  Crossing is within the West Twin Protected Area. "
13900066,Absolutely massive structure with 12 m of fill plus the height of the culvert which appears to be approximately 7m. Fill depth changed to 9.9m to satisfy submission template macros. Very nice large stream with  boulder step pool habitat suitable for bull trout.  Falls noted just downstream in FISS but not observed in field with minmal survey.
13900064,"Deep canyon and high waterfall directly downstream of crossing which is a definite barrier to all fish. Rough estimate 20m height. Outlet drop and pool estimated because it was unsafe to get near stream due to steep embankment. RB confirmed upstream of crossing in 2017 and 2020, but the falls downstream is a definite barrier.  "
13900200,"Big wetland upstream. Inlet could not be found, likely submerged. Small channel downstream, pipe looks old and in bad shape. Overflow pipe near first pipe but not functioning currently.  "
13900077,Wide channel and high flowing stream. Small outlet drop and high velocity in pipe with shallow flows over unembedded pipe. Chinook confirmed downstream near Fraser River confluence in the past. Railway bridge downstream seen in photos. 
13900030,Dewateredat crossing with large wetland area upstream. Flow goes through mainstem of Dominion Creek just north through town. 
22200081, Two pipes at 1.4m diameter each. Crossing is only 5m downstream of the railway crossing. The stream has bigger volume of water at this location than it did below Highway 5 downstream.  Water may be recharging beaver influenced wetlands downstream. Road edge has been armoured with riprap and downstream side of road bank is eroding significantly for approximately 60m.           
22201951,"Culvert runs under both sets of tracks. Model Crossing will need to be removed from bcfishpass. Outlet of this pipe is immediately upstream of Loseth road with significant armouring around the outlet pool and road at the inlet downstream. Very nice stream with significant amounts of flow. Known rainbow stream. Much less flow downstream below Highway 5,  which is very interesting."
22201176,Very nice stream with salmon point in FISS located upstream. Very good flow with some pools present to 80cm deep upstream. Unassessed railway crossing approximately 200m upstream.  There is no crossing at the pipeline but construction activities have resulted in a small cascade of boulders at the pipe which is similar to the natural cascade section observed approximately 50m upstream.  Railway crossing downstream which is ranked as a barrier.         
22200022,Very small stream with low flow. Embankment above outlet has been covered to prevent rockslide. 
22200075,"Nice little stream with good flow and abundant small gravel's upstream. There may be crossings downstream on private land. Significant amount of large riprap placed around inlet and outlet to protect the crossing. Outlet is placed on large piece of riprap, so 0.3m was added to the 0.2m outlet drop to account for the additional distance from the stream to the outlet. RB observed upstream.  "
22201218,Very nice stream with good flow and abundant gravels upstream. Pipe is an extremely bad shape with extensive corrosion inside of the pipe particularly at the downstream and - see photos.  Likely at least one crossing downstream on private land.  Transmission line corridor is located immediately upstream and the channel appears to be modified in this location to be straighter and narrower than its natural state.  No crossing immediately upstream on Goslin Road (no road - crossing should be removed as potential barrier in bcfishpass)            
22201229,"Culvert is undersized for a stream of this size. High flow,  channel is just over 10m wide upstream. Chinook confirmed downstream in the past.  "
22200067,Pipes and road are in extremely poor condition with evidence of embankment failure and pipes rusted all the way through on the bottom side in places. Small side road parallel to Highway 16 with residences that could be accessed from either side. Removal of crossing could perhaps be considered. Large high value system suitable for bulltrout rearing.  Culvert upstream is relatively new concrete box culvert on the highway which is over half embedded and 3.7m wide. 
22200051,Stream flows through private fenced off land on both sides. Moderate flow and a wide entrenched channel upstream. It appears cobbles are the predominant stream substrate and gravels subdominant. 
22200151,Newly installed culvert with beaver grate on inlet. Beaver influenced wetland area upstream and downstream. Channel width estimated as wetland areas present.  Approximately 700m downstream this stream flows into Swift Creek which is a known chinook stream.   
13900003,"Two culverts,  one bigger than the other. Debris jams at inlet creating drop and increasing stream velocity in pipe. Rail crossing upstream is a concrete OBS. Channel wider downstream than upstream."
22200029,"Small stream with low flow. Muddy, fine substrate makes up most of streambed. Very close to Fraser River. "
22200061,"Large stream with cobble boulder substrate suitable for bull trout. Concrete box culvert is 60% embedded on the downstream side. Decent amount of debris is clogging the inlet.  Although not perfect, this culvert appears to be fairly new with some embeddedment so not earmarked for follow up.  "
5400446,Nice stream with good flow and abundant gravel throughout low gradients.  Adjacent property is northern wildlife design.  Crossing is currently 100% backwaters and passable to all life stages and species at these lower flow levels.                    
5400589," Major beaver activity with inlet of pipe 3/4 blocked by mud.  0.6m overflow pipe also present.  Low gradient, willow dominated,  beaver influenced floodplain habitat upstream and downstream.  Pipe is backwatered however, the inlet is blocked so fish passage was not happening at time of assessment.  Crossing on railway upstream, not yet assessed.                 "
5400423," Two pipes at 1.8 m each,  north pipe slightly lower than south pipe at outlet.  Good sized stream with great flow for this time of year on a dry year.  Abundant black algae on gravel and cobble substrate.  Very nice stream.  Appears to have decent riparian health adjacent to the crossing but riparian buffer to be enlarged particularly on upstream south side.  Downstream crossing on highway was fully backwatered and not a barrier at the time of assessment.        "
5400024," Three 4 m diameter pipes.  All three pipes are 100% backwatered, and passable.  Road prism and pipes appear to be in good condition.  Extensive beaver activity upstream and downstream.           "
15600273,"Stream is extremely impacted by cattle ranching.  Banks eroded and trampled.  Algae indicates nutrient inputs from cows are high.  Pipes are old with a lot of rust.  Habitat value is currently very poor,  but historically would've been high.  Still a good amount of flow for a dry year.  100% backwatered however,  depth of the water is only approximately 1 cm.  Absolutely no riparian vegetation or cattle exclusion fencing on the upstream side for as far as the eye can see (approximately 1 km.).           "
24727338,100% backwatered at time of assessment. Beaver dams downstream backwatering the crossing. Pipe and road prism in great shape. Fully passable for all species and life stages at the time of assessment. Some small amount of embeddedment but only for a small piece of the pipe diameter.  Known chinook system with significant restoration works upstream.  
15600468,Agricultural land on both sides and cow pasture downstream. Fully backwatered culvert with no flowing water. Cows seen intruding into the stream channel at time of survey. 
15600468,Agricultural land on both sides and cow pasture downstream. Fully backwatered culvert with no flowing water. Cows seen in stream channel at time of survey.  Chinook observation upstream from 2019.
15600111,Stream section is part of rehab project. New - fully backwatered structure likley passable to all life stages and species at time of assessment.
15600106,"Wetland habitat upstream and downstream. Huge beaver dam on inlet side creating drop. Adjacent landowner Ron reports there are no fish near this location. He reports that beaver activity increased significantly in the past few years, that is the only reason there is water here.  "
15600488,"Wetland upstream and downstream. A lot of beaver activity upstream, big pond near inlet. Culvert is very warped on inlet side.  Chinook observations downstream on nearby Clear Creek."
15600120,"Two pipes, approx 15m apart but part of same system. No flowing water through either. Signs of beaver activity upstream. "
15600158,"Very small channel downstream, wider upstream. Small amount of flow, grassy wetland habitat. Not likely fish bearing stream section. Considered medium habitat value due to larger size of watershed and presence of some water in drought period when many adjacent systems were dry."
15605366,Wetland downstream.  Vegetated channel upstream. Several unassessed crossings downstream.
15600112,"Stream not flowing at the time of assessment.  Horse pasture downstream.  Fenced off on both sides of pipe.  Nechako Environment and Water Stewardship Society ( https://newssociety.org/watersheds/goldie-creek ) report that stream was historically impacted adjacent to this site when Highway 27 was constructed 20-30 years ago due to fill from the excavation of the highway contributing significant amounts of sediment into Stoney Creek and ultimately into the spawning beds of Nechako White Sturgeon just below the Stoney Creek/Nechako River confluence. Extensive works completed upstream of the crossing in 2021 including culvert replaced with bridge, installation of beaver dam analogues, riparian planting and addition of large woody debris just upstream of the crossing. "
5400448,"Long pipe, no outlet drop but culvert is partially backwatered at outlet. Small fish spotted in outlet pool. Upstream goes into private land and is fenced off. "
5400181,"Culvert is backwatered and fully submerged on inlet side. Outlet side barely visible. Wetland/grassy habitat upstream and downstream. Stagnant water present in pools, no flowing water. Assuming beaver activity due to beaver grate on inlet and beaver dam seen downstream in photos.  Silt fencing seen on downstream left bank and major erosion on downstream right bank, based on photos."
5403082,Backwatered at outlet but some flow upstream and downstream.  Some gravels upstream.  Private property on both sides.  RB confirmed upstream.  Downstream railway crossing yet to be assessed. 
5400193,Wetland downstream and upstream. Stream channel upstream is more defined. Pipe is fully backwatered.  Medium habitat value given due to presence of water at this location when other areas of this same stream were dry.
9905144,Obvious signs of beaver activity. Big dam near inlet and small dam just downstream of outlet as well. Small channel downstream with no water with wetland upstream.
13900028,Nice stream with good flow. Railway crossings approximately 30 m upstream are much more of a barrier then the crossing on Penny Street.
13900308,Abundant gravels present downstream and upstream. Small fish seen in culvert and downstream. There's flow upstream and downstream but culvert is backwatered.  Unassessed railway crossing ~900m upstream.
13900252,"Wide channel with four culverts. Culvert diameter totaled for all 4 culverts. Two are in good condition, other two are bent and look older. Railway crossing just upstream which consists of three culverts and appears likely passable for most species at most flows.  Abundant gravels present downstream of road.  This road is the only to access the town of Penny. "
13900050,"No well defined stream channel visible. Flooded wetland area downstream, surveyed during heavy rain. Backwatered pipe.  "
13900283,"Two pipes each with 1m diameter on the south side of the railway. It is not clear where the stream crosses under the railway upstream, this crossing still needs to be assessed.  Agricultural field located upstream with what appears to be very minimal riparian buffer. Stream has been channelized beside the railway.  A 1m overflow pipe has been installed above the level of the other 2 pipes.       "
13903627,"Big wetland area upstream. Smaller, grassy, wetland downstream.  RB confirmed upstream in the past. Culvert is very old and in bad shape. There is a bigger overflow pipe present."
13903618,Wetland lake area upstream with small channels threaded through it. Beaver grate on culvert inlet and pipe is in poor shape as it is rusted and bent out of shape. Outlet backwater for 40%. Small stream with some flow.
13900193,Culvert is a little backwatered at outlet. Small fish seen in pipe. Trib to major spawning stream. Crossing appears passable. Slight inlet drop due to woody debris. 
13903148,Wetland habitat upstream and downstream. Crossing is near transmission line so trees have been cut down. Backwatered culvert and pipe appears undersized. Chinook confirmed in the past downstream of crossing. 
22200015,"Culvert spans McLennan Rd and highway. Small stream with good flow and primarily fine substrate. Extensive beaver activity both upstream and downstream, with dams of up to 1 1/2 m high in both locations.  Very long structure.  Culvert gradient estimated as could not see through the pipe.       "
5400179,There are three 1.5m pipes located under Railway Avenue continuing all the way under the railway line.  Pipes are embedded at or more than 50% of their depth.  Stream was dry at the time of assessment and scoured channels indicate a fairly small system.
15600147,No water in pipe. Periodic pools of standing water upstream and downstream but no flowing water. NEWWS has completed restoration work for this site with sign posted at this location. Culvert appears fully embedded in photos so have changed inputs to reflect this.
15600154,"Dewatered, no well-defined stream channel. Agricultural fields on both sides.  Embeddedness estimated from photos."
5400028,"Wide channel, nicely installed moti major structure that appears passable as fully embedded.  3m falls noted in FISS as 1.3 km upstream.  Railway crossing just downstream noted as passable in bcfishpass."
13905385,"Fully embedded pipes. Three pipes total, with two at 1.8 m and one at 1.2m in diameter. Nice habitat upstream with abundant gravels, some deeper pools and deeply undercut banks."
13900265,"Embedded culvert, high flowing mountain stream. Very clear and wide channel. Gradient increases upstream.  Fully embedded pipe so likley passable for all species and life stages at perhaps all but very high flows."
13900025,Chinook and mountain whitefish confirmed just upstream in 2019. Continuously embedded culvert. Grassy habitat upstream with little riparian on streambanks near crossing. Fines were the predominant stream substrate.
22200082,Stream is mostly dewatered. Large beaver dam (1.7m high) located approximately 30m upstream. Fully embedded pipe with beaver grate on the inlet.  Unassessed crossing on private driveway upstream from here. Adjacent landowner has concerns about the recent lack of water and says it is un-characteristic for the section of stream. They have concerns that recent pipeline construction just upstream of this crossing has potentially influenced beaver populations and water flow.
13900015,Continuously embedded culvert. Wide channel with moderate flow. High value habitat
13900073,"RB and CCG confirmed downstream in past. Private agricultural land upstream and downstream. Embedded culvert. Small wooden dam just downstream of crossing, approx 0.8m high. Small trickle of water beside structure that would allow fish to swim upstream.  "
13900012,"Continuously embedded culvert. Agricultural fields upstream and downstream. Very little riparian vegetation. Small fish seen near inlet. Channel looks like it gets smaller upstream, flows through cow field. Not a fish passage issue, but riparian restoration could be pursued.  RB confirmed in the past near crossing. "
15600048,Two pipes (1.2m and 0.6m). 100% backwater. Guessing the pipes are embedded but cannot see due to poor water quality. This stream is extremely impacted by poor cattle ranching practices. There is no riparian fencing and cattle have completely trampled all the banks.  There is no riparian vegetation and water quality is extremely poor. This stream could likely be very productive for chinook and other species if eventually restored.           
5400201,Good flow. Abundant gravel downstream and upstream. Pipes are both fully embedded with partial backwatering. Chinook point on the stream immediately adjacent to the site. Upstream left bank riparian has been cleared for what appears to be a parking space.  Upstream crossing on Stella Road could be addressed by MoT.
24715754,"Three pipes total, two at 1.2m diameter which were completely submerged underwater and one at 2m diameter which was 100% backwatered.  Assuming embedded due to the depth of the backwatering. Bridge located just upstream on River Road.  Unassessed railway crossing located downstream which, based off satellite imagery, leads to a wetland area, but no modelled crossing present.  There is a second unassessed crossing (24715896) downstream which should be assessed. Multiple non-salmonid FISS observations downstream. Chinook and sockeye salmon have been observed just upstream of the confluence of this creek with the Fraser River, roughly 1km downstream of the crossing.    "
5400159,Dry channel.  Bridge.
5400180,Pipe arch. Passable.  Modelled crossings 5406290 and 5400675 downstream adjacent to Burn's Lake shoreline have not been assessed.
15604870,"Bridge with sign from Fraser lake sawmills. Extensive cattle trampling underneath the bridge, but some decent amount of water at this location."
15604704,Bridge. Good flow
15600065,Restoration work conducted at this crossing. No flowing water at time of survey. Livestock field upstream. Goats seen trampling through stream channel.
24715750,Wide stream with high flows and good habitat. Bridge on railway just upstream. Major moti structure was in the wrong spot on the map. 
9904385,Deactivated road. Ford passable by 4x4 vehicles
15600486,NA
15604176,"Deactivated road. Old culverts seen in pictures, now a ford."
5401513,"Small trail, wide channel."
