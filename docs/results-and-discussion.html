The dams were mature, well-developed, and had vegetation growing through them. Fish were observed throughout the survey area. The habitat was of medium value for rearing rainbow trout and potentially Chinook, with some pockets of gravels present. However, heavy cattle impacts had led to significant sedimentation, with fines covering much of the substrate. The beaver dams were impounding large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow downstream at the Dog Creek Road crossing. Waypoints were taken for a breached fence line (WP 32), a slumped historic road (WP 33), and the first beaver dam (WP 34).

The riparian area was intact throughout, consisting of a mix of shrub-dominated wetland areas and mature mixed forest.      &emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>Culvert data&emsp;<\/th><td><a href =sum/cv/199256.html target=\"_blank\">Culvert Data<\/a>&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>Culvert photos&emsp;<\/th><td><a href =https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_fraser_2023_reporting/main/data/photos/199256/crossing_all.JPG target=\"_blank\">Culvert Photos<\/a>&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>Model data&emsp;<\/th><td><a href =sum/bcfp/199256.html target=\"_blank\">Model Data<\/a>&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div>","<div class='scrollableContainer'><table class= id='popup'><tr><td><\/td><th>Site&emsp;<\/th><td>199260&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>Priority&emsp;<\/th><td>High&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>Stream&emsp;<\/th><td>Tributary To Sugarbowl Creek&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>Road&emsp;<\/th><td>Highway  16&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>Habitat (m)&emsp;<\/th><td>    0&emsp;<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><th>Comments&emsp;<\/th><td>The stream was a larger, steeper system with intact, mature coniferous cedar-hemlock riparian cover, primarily stable banks, and abundant large woody debris throughout.

Teepee Creek Trail was reported to cross the stream within the site, but it was not observed during the survey. Substrates were embedded, with very rare areas of unembedded gravels.

Administrative boundaries were compiled from Legal Surveys Division’s cadastral datasets and survey records archived in the Canada Lands Survey Records. Canada Lands Administrative Boundaries (CLAB) were adjusted to match British Columbia’s authoritative base mapping features. The Fresh Water Atlas (FWA) was used for streams, rivers, coastlines, and height of land. The Integrated Cadastral Fabric (ICF) was used for parcel boundaries. Tantalis Cadastre was used where ICF parcels were not available.

<p>The Provincial Obstacles to Fish Passage theme presents records of all known obstacles to fish passage from several fisheries datasets. Records from the following datasets have been included: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS); the Fish Habitat Inventory and Information Program (FHIIP); the Field Data Information System (FDIS) and the Resource Analysis Branch (RAB) inventory studies. The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known. It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage. This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species.</p>

<p>This layer is the one-year-later burn severity classification for large fires (greater than 100 ha). Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. The post-fire imagery is acquired during the subsequent growing season. Mapping conducted during the subsequent growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th.</p></li>

<p>Legally defined <strong>Municipal</strong> polygons were drawn from metes and bounds descriptions as written in Letters Patent for Municipalities in the province of British Columbia. In the event of a discrepancy in the data, the metes and bounds description will prevail.</p>
<p>Although the boundaries were drawn based on the legal metes and bounds descriptions, they may differ from how regional districts and their member municipalities and electoral areas currently view and/or manage their boundaries. Where discrepancies are noted, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (the custodian) enters into discussion with the local governments whose boundaries are affected. In order to effect a change to the boundary, Cabinet approval is required. This is done through an Order in Council (OIC). While discrepancies to administrative boundaries are being resolved, boundaries may be adjusted on an ongoing basis until the requested changes are completed.</p>
<p>The OIC_YEAR and OIC_NUMBER fields indicate the year that the boundary was passed under OIC and its associated number. The AFFECTED_ADMIN_AREA_ABRVN identifies the administrative areas that are affected by the OIC.</p>

<p>During the 2023 field season, field assessments were conducted between September 09, 2023 and October 05, 2023 by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio. and Mateo Winterscheidt, B.Sc. A total of 177 Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessments were completed.</p>

<p>During the 2024 field season, field assessments were conducted between October 04, 2024 and October 09, 2024 by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio. and Lucy Schick, B.Sc. A total of 9 Fish Passage Assessments were completed, including 7 Phase 1 assessments and 2 reassessments.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Of the 186 sites where fish passage assessments were completed, 184 were not yet inventoried in the PSCIS system. This included 20 crossings considered “passable”, 31 crossings considered “potential” barriers, and 128 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length <span class="citation">(MoE 2011)</span>. Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 5 crossings assessed were fords and were ranked as “unknown” according to the provincial protocol.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Reassessments were completed at 2 sites where PSICS data required updating.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A summary of crossings assessed, a rough cost estimate for remediation, and a priority ranking for follow-up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table <a href="results-and-discussion.html#tab:cost-est-phase-1">4.4</a>.

<p><br></p>
<p>The “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed <span class="citation">MoE (2011)</span> and represent an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout under any flow conditions that may occur throughout the year <span class="citation">(Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013)</span>. As noted in <span class="citation">Bourne et al. (2011)</span>, with a detailed review of different criteria in <span class="citation">Kemp and O’Hanley (2010)</span>, passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates <span class="citation">(Bourne et al. 2011; E. A. Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010)</span>. <span class="citation">Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009)</span> present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia.</p>

<p>During the 2024 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 13 sites within the Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, Upper Fraser River, Morkill River, and Francois Lake watershed groups. A total of approximately 14 km of stream was assessed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary.
Results are summarized in Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:map-interactive">4.1</a> and Table <a href="results-and-discussion.html#tab:tab-overview">4.5</a> with raw habitat data included in [Attachment 1 - Habitat Assessment and Fish Sampling Data]. A summary of preliminary modeling results illustrates the estimated chinook, coho, and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing, based on measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length, as presented in Figure <a href="results-and-discussion.html#fig:plot-model-all">4.2</a>. Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document.</p>

A high-quality stream with a relatively steep gradient and abundant functional large woody debris creating steps and pools 20–30mm deep. In some sections, the stream widened and became shallow, with abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Overhead cover was extensive. Near the upper end of the site, the forest had been cleared for pipeline use, resulting in significant bank erosion. and ripiran removal. A large pipe crossed the stream near the pipeline corridor. The stream was surveyed from Stella Road up to the pipeline, ~500m.

A small stream with good flow and abundant gravels, flowing through several private properties with newly established quad and foot traffic trails. Pools were limited and predominantly shallow. A significant outlet drop was present at the downstream culvert on Gala Bay Road, while the upstream culvert on Stella Road had an even larger drop, both indicating the pipes were undersized for the watershed’s flow capacity. Anecdotal information from a neighboring landowner suggested the stream below Gala Bay Road had been diverted to accommodate a driveway for a recreational property.

The stream provided excellent habitat, with abundant functional large woody debris creating occasional pools 20–30mm deep, suitable for overwintering juvenile fish. Overhead cover was extensive, and occasional gravels were suitable for spawning. A small, broken plastic pipe was present in the first 150m upstream of the culvert, likely a former water intake for adjacent properties. PSCIS crossing 203297 was located 150m upstream of Stella Road on private property, where the culvert had a significant outlet drop, creating a likely fish passage barrier. Approximately 400m upstream, the stream transitioned to a beaver-impounded area with four consecutive 1–1.5m high dams holding back a large volume of water, but flow over or under allowed possible fish passage. The impoundment area extended as far as the surveyed area. A fish (~40mm) was observed after the second beaver dam. The top of the site was marked at WP 400.

The stream was a larger system with significant beaver activity, creating impoundments behind dams ranging from 0.3 to 1.5m in height. Heavy cattle use was evident in riparian areas, with trampled banks, extensive browsing of riparian shrubs, and a significant amount of manure within seasonally inundated areas. The survey extended from Settlement Road to a large beaver dam and impoundment. Nutrient loading to the stream appeared high, with large amounts of algae present on the primarily gravel substrates in sections of the channel linking beaver-impounded areas.

The stream had good flow and provided high-quality habitat for the first 100m before beginning to run subsurface. At approximately 200m upstream of the highway, adjacent to a quarry, the stream was fully dewatered to the top of the site. The channel was highly confined and lacked complexity. Although some small and large woody debris were present, they did not appear to function in creating habitat during periods of flow. The stream was primarily a straight channel with a coarse cobble and boulder substrate. A large pile of riprap was placed at the culvert outlet, possibly to reduce the outlet drop, though its placement appeared unusual and could inhibit fish passage.

A large stream with abundant gravels suitable for Chinook spawning. Pools were infrequent, primarily located on outside bends and behind large woody debris. Some evidence of anthropogenic manipulation was observed, including cut cottonwood trees that had fallen into the channel. The riparian zone was in good condition, with mature shrub communities and old-growth cottonwood that should contribute to future habitat complexity. The culvert appeared to have been modified in the past to attempt backwatering, with boulder lines present downstream. Heavy rainfall over the previous evening and preceding weeks had raised water levels to moderate conditions. The stream was a major tributary to the Chilako River, with documented Chinook presence. The watershed was within Prince George city limits, presenting opportunities for community engagement, trail network development, educational programs, and stewardship initiatives. A significant slump on the highway approximately 300m upstream of the culvert was actively eroding; however, a healthy young deciduous and shrub-dominated riparian zone at this location likely provided some filtration and protection of water quality.

The stream was large and gravel-dominated, with extensive deep runs, deep pools, large woody debris, and multiple channels throughout. Gravels were suitable for Chinook and resident salmonid spawning. A Chinook spawner was observed upstream of the culvert in 2022. Heavy rains over the past two weeks had significantly raised water levels. A beaver dam was present within side channels at the upper end of the surveyed site. The riparian area was intact throughout, consisting of a mix of shrub-dominated wetland areas and mature mixed forest.

The stream was surveyed upstream for 750m, following the west fork at the junction. The east fork was surveyed separately (13900100_us2). The stream was a large, low-gradient gravel riffle-pool system with abundant large woody debris throughout. Banks were stable, with an intact mature coniferous riparian zone. High flows due to heavy rains over the past two weeks made pool delineation difficult, so residual depth was estimated. Gravel and small cobbles were present, likely suitable for Chinook spawning. Extensive areas of high-value habitat were observed for juvenile rearing and resident salmonid spawning.

Medium-value habitat. The stream had been heavily impacted by cattle throughout the surveyed area, with evidence of bank trampling and extensive low-gradient muddy sections. Upstream of the culvert, the stream was primarily dry for the first 300m, with young forest and shrubs. At this point, intermittent pools began to appear, associated with beaver activity. At approximately 450–500m upstream, the stream became almost entirely watered, with pools up to 40cm deep. Many surveyed areas resembled wetland habitat, with spirea, willow, alder, and trembling aspen throughout. The last 200m of the stream was incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, as it flowed more directly southeast to join the Nechako River rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River.

Heavy cattle impacts were observed throughout the surveyed area, with the most pronounced damage in low-gradient sections with easily accessible banks. The stream changed character at a beaver dam located approximately 300–350m upstream, transitioning from a channelized stream to beaver-impounded wetland areas. A fence intended to restrict cattle access had been breached. A series of beaver dams began approximately 300m upstream of the road, with over three dams observed, some up to 1.5m high. The dams were mature, well-developed, and had vegetation growing through them. Fish were observed throughout the survey area. The habitat was of medium value for rearing rainbow trout and potentially Chinook, with some pockets of gravels present. However, heavy cattle impacts had led to significant sedimentation, with fines covering much of the substrate. The beaver dams were impounding large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow downstream at the Dog Creek Road crossing. Waypoints were taken for a breached fence line (WP 32), a slumped historic road (WP 33), and the first beaver dam (WP 34). The last 200m of the stream was incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, as it flowed more directly southeast to join the Nechako River rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River.

Deep pools were present, formed by boulder and large woody debris scour. A salmon point was noted near the pipeline location in FISS. Numerous small steps ranging from 30–60cm were present due to the steep, boulder-dominated nature of the stream.

The site was surveyed from the railway up to PSCIS crossing 4931, where gradients increased significantly, indicating a new reach should begin. Approximately 100m before the end of the site, the stream showed signs of a large disturbance event that had incised the channel to a depth of 1.2–2m, with major areas of aggregation where the channel was widened and uniform. Teepee Creek Trail was reported to cross the stream within the site, but it was not observed during the survey. Substrates were embedded, with very rare areas of unembedded gravels. Due to heavy rain in the days prior to the survey, conditions were slightly turbid, making it difficult to assess the full extent of gravels, particularly within the tailouts of plunge pools.
