New Graph Environment Ltd. on behalf of Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC (SERNbc) Version 0.0.1 2025-01-24 Acknowledgement Modern civilization has a long journey ahead to acknowledge and address the historic and ongoing impacts of colonialism that have resulted in harm to the cultures and livelihoods living interconnected with our ecosystems for many thousands of years. "],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.

As the largest salmon-producing river on Canada’s west coast (Bradford and Taylor 2023; “Dakleh Placenames” n.d.), it plays a crucial economic role in supporting forestry, agriculture, and hydroelectric power generation. Additionally, the Fraser River is vital for fisheries, especially for salmon populations, which are essential to both the local ecosystem and Indigenous communities. #incomplete to the point we should not publish. Lheidli T&#39;enneh are maaaaajor stakeholders # The Upper Fraser River is commonly defined as the section of the mainstem north of Quesnel, flowing through the Cariboo and Fraser Plateau regions. Major tributaries include the Nechako, Quesnel, and McGregor rivers [@shaw_tuominenWaterQuality]. This vast expanse supports many Indigenous groups who utilize the land for cultural, spiritual, and economic practices. Among these groups are the Simpcw First Nation, occupying the North Thompson area, and the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council which unifies six nations west of Price George: the Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation (Burns Lake Band), Nadleh Whut’en First Nation, Saik’uz First Nation, Stellat’en First Nation, Takla Nation, and Wet’suwet’en First Nation [@CSTCCSFNs; @SimpcwFirstNationHistory] The Upper Fraser River, an 8th order stream, drains an area of 232,134 km2 upstream of the McGregor River confluence. The seasonal hydrograph has a single broad peak in early summer due to snow and glacial melt from surrounding mountain ranges (Figures 2.2 - 2.3). The mean annual discharge at station 08KA005 in McBride, located roughly 200km southeast of Prince George, is 200.9 m3/. lfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08KA005&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08KA005.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Fraser River At Mcbride (Station #08KA005 - Lat 53.30172 Lon -120.14092).

Traditionally, they lived off the land near Tsetl&#39;adak Bunk&#39;ut &quot;Peak Rock Lake&quot; (Cheslatta Lake), however, in 1952, the construction of the Kenney Dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) and the subsequent flooding of the Nechako Reservoir forced the Cheslatta Carrier people to abandon their ancestral lands [@HistoryCheslattaCarrierNation; @DaklehPlacenames]. This relocation was done with little notice or compensation, causing significant disruptions to their community, culture, and way of life. Despite these challenges, the Cheslatta Carrier Nation has worked to preserve their cultural heritage and advocate for their rights and land restoration. # # &lt;br&gt; # nechako fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(356362759) # endako fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(356361442) %&gt;% mutate(area_km2 = round(area_ha/100, 1)) %&gt;% mutate(area_km2 = ifelse(area_km2 &gt;= 1000, format(area_km2, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;, scientific = FALSE), area_km2)) %&gt;% pull(area_km2) # chilako fwapgr::fwa_watershed_at_measure(356363121) %&gt;% mutate(area_km2 = round(area_ha/100, 1)) %&gt;% mutate(area_km2 = ifelse(area_km2 &gt;= 1000, format(area_km2, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;, scientific = FALSE), area_km2)) %&gt;% pull(area_km2) The Nechako River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 47,269km2. Beginning at the Nechako Plateau, it flows north towards Fort Fraser then east to its confluence with the Fraser River in Prince George. The Nachako River has three main tributaries: the Stuart River, the Endako River, and the Chilako River. It has a mean annual discharge of 141.3 m3/s at station 08JC001 located in Vanderhoof and 278.5 m3/s at station 08JC002 located in Isle Pierre, ~25km downstream of the Stuart River confluence. Flow patterns at Isle Pierre are heavily influenced by inflows from the Stuart River (enters downstream of Vanderhoof) resulting in higher peak levels and average discharge (Figures 2.4 - 2.5).
