"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Since 2023, the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc), with funding from the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, has been actively involved in planning, coordinating, and conducting fish passage restoration efforts within the Upper Fraser River watershed. The primary objective of this project is to identify and prioritize fish passage barriers within these study areas, develop comprehensive restoration plans to address these barriers, and foster momentum for broader ecosystem restoration initiatives. While the primary focus is on fish passage, this work also serves as a lens through which to view the broader ecosystems, leveraging efforts to build capacity for ecosystem restoration and improving our understanding of watershed health. We recognize that the health of life - such as our own - and the health of our surroundings are interconnected, with our overall well-being dependent on the health of our environment. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.

Their name, Dakelh, translates to “people who travel by water,” reflecting their reliance on rivers such as the Lhtakoh (Fraser), Nechakoh (Nechako), and Nak’alkoh (Stuart) for transportation, trade, and sustenance (Hudson 2010). The Dakelh were key participants in the Grease Trails, trading inland goods for coastal eulachon oil (Hudson 2010). Their Athabaskan language, Dakelh, has declined due to colonial policies, but revitalization efforts are ongoing. Organizations like the Yinka Dene Language Institute work to document and promote Dakelh through education, literacy programs, and linguistic research (“The Yinka Déné Language Institute” 2025). The Lheidli T’enneh First Nation and local school districts have also developed language programs to preserve and teach Dakelh (“Our Language” (2025)). The Dakelh people traditionally organize their lands into Keyohs, family-run territories passed down through generations. Each Keyoh is overseen by a Keyohwhudachun (Keyoh Holder), who manages land use and stewardship (“Keyoh Huwunliné” 2025). Despite historical disruptions, Keyohs remain central to Dakelh identity and land management practices. 2.2.1 Lheidli T’enneh The Lheidli T’enneh First Nations are a Dakelh sub-group whose traditional territory encompasses the Nechakoh (Nechako) River, Lhtakoh (Fraser) River, and Morkill River, and spans from west of Lheidli (Prince George) to Valemount. “Lheidli” translates to “The People from the Confluence of the River,” referring to the meeting of the Nechako (“Nee Incha Koh” – “river with strong undercurrents”) and Fraser (“Ltha Koh” – “Big Mouth River”) rivers in what is now Prince George, British Columbia (“Our Story” 2025). Located within the traditional territory of the Lheidli T’enneh is Chun T’oh Whudujut (Ancient Forest), a Provincial Park and Protected Area 120km east of Prince George. The park has thousand-year-old western red cedars and a rich biodiversity of plants, mosses, lichens and fungi which can be explored through the trail network. Historically, Lheidli people would visit the stands from summer fishing camps along the upper Fraser River as well as gather medicinal plants, some of which were thought to be extinct. However, the park was not always a protected area and was initially slated for logging until a UNBC graduate student studying lichen biodiversity identified the ancient stands of western red cedars. Recognizing their ecological and cultural significance, trails were developed to highlight the cedars and advocate for their protection. Through partnerships with local hiking groups, UNBC, Lheidli T’enneh, and the Provincial Government, the Ancient Forest biodiversity assessment project has contributed to conservation efforts and tourism-based economic development in the Prince George area (“Chun t’oh Whudujut (Ancient Forest)” 2025). 2.2.2 Carrier Sekani The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council unifies six nations west of Lheidli (Prince George) whose traditional territories include the Lhtakoh (Fraser), Nechakoh (Nechako), Tsalakoh (Chilako), Endako, and Nadleh (Nautley) Rivers (“About CSTC and the CSFNs” n.d.). The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council includes: Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation - located near Burns Lake Nadleh Whut’en First Nation - located near Fraser Lake Saik’uz First Nation - located near Vanderhoof Stellat’en First Nation - located near Fraser Lake Takla Nation - located near Takla Lake Wet’suwet’en First Nation - located west of Burns Lake 2.2.3 Nazko Nazko, meaning “river flowing from the south,” is a Dakelh sub-group located 120 km west of Quesnel along the Nazko River. Originally known for its strong ranching history, the community expanded into forestry in the 1980s, establishing Nazko Logging, a successful enterprise that created jobs and supported economic growth (Adams and Stokes 2025). 2.3 Simpcw Simpcw, which translates to “People of the Rivers”, is one of the 17 campfires (bands) that make up the Secwepemc, or Shuwap Nation. Their traditional territory stretches from north of McBride, south to Barrier, and east to Mt.Robson Provincial Park, and includes the North Thompson River and the Upper Fraser River (“About Us – Simpcw” n.d.). 2.4 Lhtakoh Known as the Lhtakoh, meaning “rivers within one another” to the Dakelh (Carrier) people, the Fraser River stretches nearly 1,400 kilometers from the Rocky Mountains of Mount Robson Provincial Park to the Strait of Georgia near Vancouver. As the largest salmon-producing river on Canada’s west coast (Bradford and Taylor 2023; “Dakleh Placenames” n.d.), it plays a crucial economic role in supporting forestry, agriculture, and hydroelectric power generation. Additionally, the Fraser River is vital for fisheries, especially for salmon populations, which are essential to both the local ecosystem and indigenous communities. The Upper Fraser River is commonly defined as the section of the mainstem north of Quesnel, flowing through the Cariboo and Fraser Plateau regions. Major tributaries include the Nechako, Quesnel, and McGregor rivers (D. P. Shaw and Tuominen, n.d.). This vast expanse supports many indigenous groups who utilize the land for cultural, spiritual, and economic practices. The Upper Fraser River, an 8th order stream, drains an area of 232,134 km2 upstream of the McGregor River confluence. The seasonal hydrograph has a single broad peak in early summer due to snow and glacial melt from surrounding mountain ranges (Figure 2.2). The mean annual discharge at station 08KA005 in McBride, located roughly 200km southeast of Prince George, is 200.4 m3/. sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08KA005&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08KA005.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Fraser River At Mcbride (Station #08KA005 - Lat 53.30172 Lon -120.14092).

Beginning at the Nechako Plateau, it flows north towards Fort Fraser then east to its confluence with the Fraser River in Prince George. The Nachako River has three main tributaries: the Stuart River, the Endako River, and the Chilako River. It has a mean annual discharge of 141.3 m3/s at station 08JC001 located in Vanderhoof and 278.5 m3/s at station 08JC002 located in Isle Pierre, ~25km downstream of the Stuart River confluence. Flow patterns at Isle Pierre are heavily influenced by inflows from the Stuart River (enters downstream of Vanderhoof) resulting in higher peak levels and average discharge (Figure 2.3). The hygrograph at station 08JC001 in Vanderhoof peaks in June and August, with lower peak levels and average discharge (Figure 2.3). The Nechako River, meaning “Blackwater people’s river”, is home to the Cheslatta Carrier Nation who are part of the Dakelh people. Traditionally, they lived off the land near Tsetl’adak Bunk’ut “Peak Rock Lake” (Cheslatta Lake), however, in 1952, the construction of the Kenney Dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (now Rio Tinto Alcan) and the subsequent flooding of the Nechako Reservoir forced the Cheslatta Carrier people to abandon their ancestral lands (“The History of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation” n.d.; “Dakleh Placenames” n.d.). This relocation was done with little notice or compensation, causing significant disruptions to their community, culture, and way of life. Despite these challenges, the Cheslatta Carrier Nation has worked to preserve their cultural heritage and advocate for their rights and land restoration. # starting at 1948 because that&#39;s where consistent data starts sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08JC001&quot;, start_year = 1948) sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08JC002&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08JC001.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08JC002.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Hydrograph for Nechako River at Vanderhoof (Station #08JC001)(left) and at Isle Pierre (Station #08JC002)(right). 2.6 Endako River The Endako River is a 6th order stream that flows south east from Burns Lake to Fraser Lake. It drains an area of 5,970km2. There is one hydrometric station on the Endako River located in Endako, but it was only active for one year during 1951. Given the one year of data, the mean annual discharge is 12.7 m3/s at station 08JB004. The hydrograph peaks in May-June (Figure 2.4). sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08JB004&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08JB004.png&quot;) Figure 2.4: Endako River At Endako (Station #08JB004 - Lat 54.08194 Lon -125.021111). Available mean daily discharge data from 1950 to 1951. 2.7 Tsalakoh The Chilako River, known as the Tsalakoh by the Dakelh people, translates to the “beaver paw river”. It is a 6th order stream that flows north from the Nechako Plateau to the Nechako River and drains an area of 3,634km2. There is one hydrometric station on the Chilako River located ~10km upstream of the mouth, but it was only active from 1960-1974. Given this data, the hydrograph peaks in May-June (Figure 2.5). sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08JC005&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08JC005.png&quot;) Figure 2.5: Chilako River Near Prince George (Station #08JC005 - Lat 53.808891 Lon -122.988892). Available mean daily discharge data from 1960 to 1974. 2.8 Fisheries The Fraser River watershed is the largest salmon-producing river system in British Columbia and one of the most significant on the Pacific Coast. It provides critical habitat for anadromous salmonids, resident freshwater species, and other aquatic organisms. The river supports indigenous, commercial, and recreational fisheries, with Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) playing a key ecological and economic role. 2.8.1 Lhtakoh The Fraser River mainstem serves as the primary migration corridor for all anadromous fish species returning to spawn in its tributaries. Historically, the Fraser supported some of the largest sockeye and chinook salmon runs in North America. However, climate change, habitat degradation, and fisheries pressures have led to declining salmon populations in recent decades. Upper Fraser sockeye populations have been in decline for several decades, likely due to reduced flows and altered water temperatures, affecting migration and spawning success (Levy and Nicklin 2018). The Early Stuart and Late Stuart sockeye are now classified as “Endangered” by COSEWIC (COSEWIC 2017). Under the Wild Salmon Policy, several Upper Fraser sockeye conservation units have been classified as “red-zoned” (Levy and Nicklin 2018). The Fraser River mainstem serves as the primary migration corridor for all anadromous fish species returning to spawn in its tributaries. Historically, the Fraser supported some of the largest sockeye and chinook salmon runs in North America. However, climate change, habitat degradation, and fisheries pressures have led to declining salmon populations in recent decades. The 2019 Big Bar landslide created a significant barrier to salmon migration in the Fraser River, further stressing already vulnerable populations. Extensive mitigation efforts, including rock removal and the construction of a fishway, have helped improve passage, with an estimated 2.9 million salmon successfully navigating the site in 2022. The Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance (UFFCA) has played a key role in supporting emergency response and recovery planning, working with federal and provincial agencies to ensure First Nations’ interests and traditional knowledge are incorporated into long-term recovery strategies. This includes ongoing monitoring, habitat restoration, and collaborative management to mitigate future risks to Fraser salmon populations (“Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance,” n.d.). 2.8.2 Nechakoh The Nechako River, a tributary of the Fraser River, supports Chinook salmon populations and serves as a migration corridor for sockeye salmon that spawn in the Stuart and Nadina/Francois Basins. Since the construction of the Kenney Dam in the 1950s, flows in the Nechako River have been regulated by Rio Tinto Alcan for hydroelectric power generation at the Kemano Generating Station on the Pacific Coast. In response to concerns over impacts on Nechako Chinook and Upper Fraser sockeye, flow management practices have been implemented. Since 1987, the Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program (NFCP) has operated an annual monitoring program, focussed on Nechako Chinook and migratory sockeye salmon designed to monitor the effectiveness of conservation measures specified in the 1987 Settlement Agreement between Canada, British Columbia, and Alcan (Levy and Nicklin 2018). The Nechako River also supports a genetically distinct and endangered population of white sturgeon with low natural recruitment. To address this decline, the Nechako White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative (NWSRI) was established, implementing conservation measures such as the Nechako White Sturgeon Conservation Centre. The facility focuses on conservation aquaculture to maintain genetic diversity and support population recovery. Since 2006, the NWSRI has been releasing tagged juvenile sturgeon annually into the Nechako River to aid in species restoration (“Nechako White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative | Home” n.d.). Indigenous fisheries organizations, including individual First Nations, the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council, and the Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance (UFFCA), are actively involved in fisheries management in the Nechako watershed. These organizations work to support conservation while ensuring the sustainability of Indigenous fisheries, which have cultural and subsistence importance (“Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance,” n.d.). 2.8.3 François Lake François Lake is one of the largest natural lakes in BC and supports landlocked Kokanee (O. nerka), as well as migratory sockeye salmon that access the lake via the Stellako River. François Lake is a key rearing area for juvenile salmon before migrating to the Fraser River. 2.8.4 Morkill River The Morkill River, a tributary of the Upper Fraser, supports Bull Trout, Mountain Whitefish, and Rainbow Trout. It has limited salmon presence but contributes cold water inputs to the Fraser River, which may benefit migrating fish during warm summer months. 2.8.5 Salmon Stock Assessment Data Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data was accessed via the NuSEDS-New Salmon Escapement Database System through the Open Government Portal with results presented in Table 2.1.

Engagement actions have included video conference calls, meetings, emails, presentations and phone calls. 3.1.2 Collaborative GIS Environment Geographical Information Systems are essential for developing and communicating restoration plans as well as the reasons they are required and how they are developed. Without the ability to visualize the landscape and the data that is used to make decisions, it is difficult to conduct and communicate the need for restoration, the details of past and future plans as well as and the potential results of physical works. To facilitate the planning and implementation of restoration activities, a collaborative GIS environment has been established using QGIS and is served on the cloud using source code stored here. This environment is intended to be a space where project team members can access, view, and contribute to the amalgamation of background spatial data and the development of restoration as well as monitoring for the project. The collaborative GIS environment allows users to view, edit, and analyze shared, up to date spatial data on personal computers in an office setting as well as on phones and tablets in the field. At the time of reporting, the environment was being used to develop and share maps, conduct spatial analyses, communicate restoration plans to stakeholders as well as to provide a central place to store methodologies and tools for conducting field assessments on standardized pre-developed digital forms. The platform can also be used to track the progress of restoration activities and monitor changes in the landscape over time, helping encourage the record keeping of past and future restoration activities in a coordinated manner. The shared QGIS project was created using scripts currently kept in dff-2022 with the precise calls to project creation scripts tracked in the project_creation_and_permissions.txt document kept in the main QGIS project directory. Information about the scripts used for GIS project creation and updates can be viewed here with outcomes of their use summarized below: Download and clip user specified layers from the BC Data Catalogue as well as data layers stored in custom Amazon Web Services buckets for an area of interest defined by a list of watershed groups and load to a geopackage called background_layers.gpkg stored in the main directory of the project. A project directory is created to hold the spatial data and QGIS project information (ie. layer symbology and naming conventions, metadata, etc.). Metadata for individual project spatial layers is kept in the rfp_tracking table within the background_layers.gpkg along with tables related to user supplied stream width/gradient inputs to bcfishpass to model potentially high value habitat that is accessible to fish species of interest. 3.1.3 Issue Tracking “Issues” logged on the online github platform are effective ways to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs related to project components. They can be referenced with the scripts, text and actions used to address them by linking documentation to the issues with text comments or programatically through git commit messages. Issues for this project are kept here. 3.1.4 Mapping The workflows to produce the georeferenced pdf maps include using a QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required and are continuously evolving. At the time of reporting - mapping scripts and associated layer file were kept under version control within bcfishpass here. Loading the QGIS layer file within a QGIS project, allows load and representation of all map component layers provided the user points to a postgresql database populated via bcfishpass outputs. 3.2 Planning 3.2.1 Habitat Modelling Habitat modelling used to help guide planning for field assessments is generated by bcfishpass (Norris [2020] 2024) which has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation by generating a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity. We utilize the bcfishpass access model and linear spawning/rearing habitat model for planning purposes. These models provide a valuable starting point, but their results are not definitive and should always be considered with professional judgment. Detailed information regarding model parameters and limitations can be found at the following links: bcfishpass background information Access model Linear spawning/rearing habitat model The access model identifies natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classify the accessibility of streams for fish (Norris [2020] 2021). On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with numerous parameters including known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, and an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams). Furthermore, mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area, stream discharge, and channel width can be collated using bcfishpass, fwapg and bcfishobs. This information can be used to provide an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored, by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. The linear spawning and rearing habitat model uses species-specific thresholds for stream gradient (Table 3.1), channel width or discharge, network connectivity, and habitat type to assess the intrinsic potential of streams to support spawning and rearing. It also incorporates documented spawning locations and literature-derived parameters to refine habitat suitability estimates. This model helps guide field assessments and prioritize locations for fish passage restoration. Regarding gradients, bcfishpass calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this phase of the project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate “potentially accessible habitat” were based on estimated max gradients that rainbow trout (20%) and bull trout (25%) are likely to be capable of ascending. Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value rearing, overwintering, and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream). Following delineation of “potentially accessible habitat”, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 20% and 25% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories. Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. To obtain estimates of channel width upstream of crossing locations, where available, bcfishpass was utilized to pull average channel gradients from Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) site assessment data (MoE 2019) or PSCIS assessment data (MoE 2021) and associate with stream segment lines. When both FISS and PSCIS values were associated with a particular stream segment, or multiple FISS channel widths are available a mean of the average channel widths was used. To model channel width for 2nd order and above stream segments without associated FISS or PSCIS sites, first fwapg was used to estimate the drainage area upstream of the segment. Then, rasters from ClimateBC (Wang et al. 2012) were downloaded to a postgresql database, sampled for upstream watershed areas associated with each stream segment and a mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area was calculated. In early 2021, Bayesian statistical methods were developed to predict channel width in all provincial freshwater atlas stream segments where width measurements had not previously been measured in the field. The model was based on the relationship between watershed area and mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area (Thorley and Irvine 2021). In December of 2021, Thorley and Irvine (2021) methods were updated using a power model derived by Finnegan et al. (2005) which relates stream discharge to watershed area and mean annual precipitation. Data (n = 24849) on watershed size, mean annual precipitation and measured channel width was extracted from the provincial freshwater atlas (FLNRORD 2021; GeoBC 2022), the BC Data Catalogue fisheries datasets (MoE 2024b, 2021) and Wang et al. (2012) utilizing bcfishpass (Norris [2020] 2021) and fwapg (Norris [2019] 2021). Details of this analysis and subsequent outputs can be reviewed in Attachment 3 (Thorley, Norris, and Irvine 2021). #`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)}` species &lt;- c(&#39;CH&#39;, &#39;CM&#39;, &#39;CO&#39;, &#39;PK&#39;, &#39;SK&#39;, &#39;ST&#39;, &#39;BT&#39;) text_footnote &lt;- &quot;&quot; #&quot;Models for RB, GR and KO are under a process of development and have not yet been released.

The reader is referred to (MoE 2011) for detailed methodology. Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, road fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.5). fpr_table_habvalue |&gt; knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T, label = NA) |&gt; kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) |&gt; kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.5: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Tables 3.6 - 3.7). These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data, a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(V4 = names(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) |&gt; dplyr::select(V4, everything()) |&gt; janitor::row_to_names(1) |&gt; ##turn the table sideways dplyr::mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.6: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier The habitat gain index is the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 20% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of anadromous species (steelhead) are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For reporting of Phase 1 - fish passage assessments within the body of this report (Table 3.6), a “total” value of habitat &lt;20% output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 20% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, steelhead rearing maximum gradient threshold (8.5%) was used. To generate estimates for area of habitat upstream (m2), the estimated linear length was multiplied by half the downstream channel width measured (overall triangular channel shape) as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they allow a rough idea of the best candidates for follow up. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from MoE (2011) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. Based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts, for this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type . Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. 3.3.1 Cost Estimates Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to help refine estimates which have since been adjusted for inflation in 2020 and based on past experience. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $30000/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 15m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $100k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page then adjusted for inflation in 2020). For larger streams (&gt;6m), estimated span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream. For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 15 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.8) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. sfpr_xref_road_cost() |&gt; dplyr::mutate(cost_m_1000s_bridge = formatC(cost_m_1000s_bridge * 15000, format=&quot;d&quot;, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(cost_embed_cv = formatC(cost_embed_cv * 1000, format=&quot;d&quot;, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;)) |&gt; dplyr::rename( Class = my_road_class, Surface = my_road_surface, `Class Multiplier` = road_class_mult, `Surface Multiplier` = road_surface_mult, `Bridge $/15m` = cost_m_1000s_bridge, `Streambed Simulation $` = cost_embed_cv ) |&gt; dplyr::filter(!is.na(Class)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(Class = dplyr::case_when( Class == &#39;fsr&#39; ~ stringr::str_to_upper(Class), TRUE ~ stringr::str_to_title(Class)), Surface = stringr::str_to_title(Surface) ) |&gt; # filter(Class != &#39;FSR&#39; &amp; Surface != &#39;Paved&#39;) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.8: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

Completed designs are loaded to the PSCIS data portal. 3.5 Habitat Confirmation Assessments Following fish passage assessments, habitat confirmations were completed in accordance with procedures outlined in the document “A Checklist for Fish Habitat Confirmation Prior to the Rehabilitation of a Stream Crossing” (Fish Passage Technical Working Group 2011). The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.5). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collected on “Site Cards”. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to a minimum distance 300m and upstream to a minimum distance of 500 - 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. # Need to move text with code to code block then comment out. Apparently even if you comment out text with code in an rmd file the code still runs. # ## Fish Sampling # # ### Electrofishing # Fish sampling was conducted on a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. Electrofishing was utilized for fish sampling according to stream inventory standards and procedures found in the Reconnaissance (1:20 000) Fish and Fish Habitat Inventory Manual [@resourcesinventorycommittee2001Reconnaissance20a]. A Haltech 2000 backpack electrofisher was used within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings and seconds, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start and end locations, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. # # # &lt;!-- We did not use minnow trapping in 2024 and unsure if we will in the future so leaving this commented out for now. Another section to add in the future will be eDNA sampling. --&gt; # &lt;!-- ### Minnowtrapping --&gt; # # &lt;!-- In the case where electrofishing was not a sufficient method of fish sampling, such as deep areas, streams with insufficient conductance, or temperatures below 5 degrees, minnowtraps were used. --&gt; # # # ### Fish Handling and Processing # Captured fish were held in buckets with sufficient water to minimize stress until processing, and multiple buckets were used when catch numbers were high. For each fish captured, fork length, weight and species was recorded with results documented in the fish data submission spreadsheet. # # ### Pit Tagging # # Fish with a fork length greater than 60 mm and belonging to species approved under the scientific fish collection permit `r fish_col_permit_num` were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) using the [Abdominal Cavity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CKZ9yaS5o8) method outlined by Biomark. To anesthetize fish prior to pit tagging, we used a solution of approximately 0.1 mL of clove oil per 1 L of water (1:10,000). This concentration was selected for its efficiency in providing effective sedation with minimal residual effects, making it ideal for studies in which fish are released back into their natural habitats [@fernandes_etal2017efficacyclove]. The clove oil solution was prepared in advance by dissolving pure clove oil in ethyl alcohol in a 1:9 ratio (clove oil: ethyl alcohol) to enhance solubility, then mixed into the water bucket [@fernandes_etal2017efficacyclove]. Fish were immersed in this solution until they reached an appropriate level of anesthesia for handling and then were tagged. To maintain needle sharpness and minimize injury risk, needles were replaced approximately every 10 fish. Each tagged fish was scanned with the PIT reader, and both the PIT tag ID and row ID were recorded. Once tagged, fish were placed into a bucket of fresh water and allowed to recover before being released back into the stream. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit `r fish_col_permit_num`. 3.6 Remediations Structure replacement was conducted by project specific contractors. As-built drawings were completed and loaded to the PSCIS data portal. 3.7 Climate Change Risk Assessment In collaboration with the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MoTi), a new climate change replacement program aims to prioritize vulnerable culverts for replacement (pers. comm Sean Wong, 2022) based on data collected and ranked related to three categories - culvert condition, vulnerability and priority. Within the “condition” risk category - data was collected and crossings were ranked based on erosion, embankment and blockage issues. The “climate” risk category included ranked assessments of the likelihood of both a flood event affecting the culvert as well as the consequence of a flood event affecting the culvert. Within the “priority” category the following factors were ranked - traffic volume, community access, cost, constructability, fish bearing status and environmental impacts (Table 3.9).

Records from the following datasets have been included: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS); the Fish Habitat Inventory and Information Program (FHIIP); the Field Data Information System (FDIS) and the Resource Analysis Branch (RAB) inventory studies. The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known. It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage. This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species. whse_fish.fiss_stream_sample_sites_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e616864b-8991-42d1-a2f9-4d4402c32be8 This spatial layer displays stream inventory sample sites that have had full or partial surveys, and contains measurements or indicator information of the data collected at each survey site on each date. whse_fish.pscis_assessment_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/7ecfafa6-5e18-48cd-8d9b-eae5b5ea2881 Points where a fish passage assessment has been performed on a stream crossing structure.

Design points have been identified as a priority for remediation based on a variety of potential criteria: quality of habitat upstream, quantity of fish habitat upstream, number and importance of species present, operational plans for the road cost of the proposed remediation, etc. They are sites where the amount of habitat to be gained by remediation has been confirmed and where a design has actually been completed. whse_fish.pscis_habitat_confirmation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/572595ab-0a25-452a-a857-1b6bb9c30495 Points where an evaluation of the fish habitat up and downstream of a road crossing have been carried out. Phase 2 of 4 in the Fish Passage Workflow, Habitat Confirmations are done at sites where the crossing structure is known to be a failure. The Habitat Confirmation is performed to ensure that the site in question is a good candidate for moving on to the Design (Phase 3) and Remediation (Phase 4) stages of the workflow. The Habitat Confirmation confirms the crossing is a barrier, places the crossing in context with respect to other roads and crossings in the watershed and also quantifies and qualifies how much habitat will be gained if the site is fixed. whse_fish.pscis_remediation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/1596afbf-f427-4f26-9bca-d78bceddf485 Points where a barrier to fish passage has been rectified or remediated.

Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. The post-fire imagery is acquired during the subsequent growing season. Mapping conducted during the subsequent growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th. Please note, this layer is 1-year-later burn severity dataset. The same-year burn severity mapping dataset (WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SAME_YR_SP) is considered an interim product to this layer. 4.2.0.1 Methodology: • Select suitable pre- and post-fire imagery or create a cloud/snow/smoke-free composite from multiple images scenes • Calculate normalized burn severity ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire images • Calculate difference NBR (dNBR) where dNBR = pre NBR – post NBR • Apply a scaling equation (dNBR_scaled = dNBR*1000 + 275)/5) • Apply BARC thresholds (76, 110, 187) to create a 4-class image (unburned, low severity, medium severity, and high severity) • Apply region-based filters to reduce noise • Confirm burn severity analysis results through visual quality control • Produce a vector dataset and apply Euclidian distance smoothing whse_imagery_and_base_maps.aimg_orthophoto_tiles_poly https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/60d873d3-2e91-4c56-8e30-e5cb2872d1f8 A set of polygons representing the geographic coverage of all individual orthophotos from the provincial collection that are available for sale to the public. whse_imagery_and_base_maps.mot_culverts_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/89d44ba6-7236-48ed-afab-f25a98c846ef A Culvert is a pipe (less than 3m in diameter) or half-round flume used to transport or drain water under or away from the road and/or right of way.

Forest licensees are not required to follow direction provided by non-legal OGMAs when preparing FSPs, and may choose to manage required old growth biodiversity targets in other ways. OGMAs, in combination with other areas where forestry development is prevented or constrained, are used to achieve biodiversity targets. Please see the Additional Information and Object Description Comments below. whse_legal_admin_boundaries.abms_municipalities_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e3c3c580-996a-4668-8bc5-6aa7c7dc4932 Legally defined Municipal polygons were drawn from metes and bounds descriptions as written in Letters Patent for Municipalities in the province of British Columbia. In the event of a discrepancy in the data, the metes and bounds description will prevail. Although the boundaries were drawn based on the legal metes and bounds descriptions, they may differ from how regional districts and their member municipalities and electoral areas currently view and/or manage their boundaries. Where discrepancies are noted, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (the custodian) enters into discussion with the local governments whose boundaries are affected. In order to effect a change to the boundary, Cabinet approval is required. This is done through an Order in Council (OIC). While discrepancies to administrative boundaries are being resolved, boundaries may be adjusted on an ongoing basis until the requested changes are completed. The OIC_YEAR and OIC_NUMBER fields indicate the year that the boundary was passed under OIC and its associated number. The AFFECTED_ADMIN_AREA_ABRVN identifies the administrative areas that are affected by the OIC. See all of the administrative areas currently in the Administrative Boundaries Management System (ABMS). The complimentary point dataset that defines the administrative areas is also available. Other individual legally defined administrative area datasets are available from the following records: Regional Districts Electoral Areas Province of British Columbia Islands Trust Local Trust Areas whse_mineral_tenure.og_pipeline_area_appl_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/b02092f9-b053-438b-9e86-157477d78faa Applications for land authorizations representing the right of way for pipeline activities.

The view was created to provide a simplified view of this data from the administrative boundaries information in the Tantalis operational system whse_tantalis.ta_park_ecores_pa_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/1130248f-f1a3-4956-8b2e-38d29d3e4af7 This dataset contains parks and protected areas managed for important conservation values and are dedicated for the preservation of their natural environments for the inspiration, use and enjoyment of the public. Places of special ecological importance are designated as ecological reserves for scientific research and educational purposes. Source data is Tantalis. *April 18, 2018: Prior to this date this dataset had one spatial boundary per park per survey plan that intersected the boundary of that park. This resulted in multiple identical boundaries for each park that had more than one survey plan overlapping it’s boundaries. The change aggregated the park data so that there is just one boundary per park with the plan numbers concatenated into a single column where each different plan number is separated by a comma. whse_wildlife_management.wcp_fish_sensitive_ws_poly https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/1a560a12-9be1-49a4-971a-dbc80875a0d7 The dataset contains approved legal boundaries for fisheries sensitive watersheds. A FSW is a mapped area with specific management objectives intended to guide development activities which may adversely impact important fish values * Metadata information for bcfishpass and bcfishobs layers can be provided here in the future but currently can usually be sourced from https://smnorris.github.io/bcfishpass/06_data_dictionary.html . 4.3 Phase 1 - Fish Passage Assessemnts During the 2023 field season, field assessments were conducted between September 09, 2023 and October 05, 2023 by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio. and Mateo Winterscheidt, B.Sc. A total of 177 Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessments were completed. During the 2024 field season, field assessments were conducted between October 04, 2024 and October 09, 2024 by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio. and Lucy Schick, B.Sc. A total of 9 Fish Passage Assessments were completed, including 7 Phase 1 assessments and 2 reassessments. Of the 186 sites where fish passage assessments were completed, 184 were not yet inventoried in the PSCIS system. This included 20 crossings considered “passable”, 31 crossings considered “potential” barriers, and 128 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011). Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 5 crossings assessed were fords and were ranked as “unknown” according to the provincial protocol. Reassessments were completed at 2 sites where PSICS data required updating. A summary of crossings assessed, a rough cost estimate for remediation, and a priority ranking for follow-up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table 4.4. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. The “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed MoE (2011) and represent an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout under any flow conditions that may occur throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and O’Hanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; E. A. Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. tab_cost_est_phase1 |&gt; select(`PSCIS ID`:`Cost Est ( $K)`) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments ranked as a &#39;barrier&#39; or &#39;potential&#39; barrier. &quot;, sp_network_caption), scroll = gitbook_on) Table 4.4: Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments ranked as a ‘barrier’ or ‘potential’ barrier.

Confirmation Assessments During the 2024 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 13 sites within the Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, Upper Fraser River, Morkill River, and Francois Lake watershed groups. A total of approximately 14 km of stream was assessed. Georeferenced field maps are provided in Attachment 1. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. Results are summarized in Figure 4.1 and Table 4.5 with raw habitat data included in Attachment 2. A summary of preliminary modeling results illustrates the estimated Chinook, coho, and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing, based on measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length, as presented in Figure 4.2. Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document. table_phase2_overview &lt;- function(dat, caption_text = &#39;&#39;, font = font_set, scroll = TRUE){ dat2 &lt;- dat |&gt; kable(caption = caption_text, booktabs = T, label = NA) |&gt; kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font) |&gt; kableExtra::column_spec(column = c(10), width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) |&gt; kableExtra::column_spec(column = c(1:9), width_max = &#39;1in&#39;) if(identical(scroll,TRUE)){ dat2 &lt;- dat2 |&gt; kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;, height = &quot;500px&quot;) } dat2 } tab_overview |&gt; table_phase2_overview(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Overview of habitat confirmation sites. &quot;, sp_rearing_caption), scroll = gitbook_on) Table 4.5: Overview of habitat confirmation sites.

In some sections, the stream widened and became shallow, with abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Overhead cover was extensive. Near the upper end of the site, the forest had been cleared for pipeline use, resulting in significant bank erosion. and ripiran removal. A large pipe crossed the stream near the pipeline corridor. The stream was surveyed from Stella Road up to the pipeline, ~500m. 199171 Burnt Cabin Creek Gala Bay Road MOTI 388944 5997001 10 – 0.0 Medium A small stream with good flow and abundant gravels, flowing through several private properties with newly established quad and foot traffic trails. Pools were limited and predominantly shallow. A significant outlet drop was present at the downstream culvert on Gala Bay Road, while the upstream culvert on Stella Road had an even larger drop, both indicating the pipes were undersized for the watershed’s flow capacity. Anecdotal information from a neighboring landowner suggested the stream below Gala Bay Road had been diverted to accommodate a driveway for a recreational property. 199172 Scotch Creek Stella Road MoTi 388269 5996948 10 – 0.0 Medium The stream provided excellent habitat, with abundant functional large woody debris creating occasional pools 20–30mm deep, suitable for overwintering juvenile fish. Overhead cover was extensive, and occasional gravels were suitable for spawning. A small, broken plastic pipe was present in the first 150m upstream of the culvert, likely a former water intake for adjacent properties. PSCIS crossing 203297 was located 150m upstream of Stella Road on private property, where the culvert had a significant outlet drop, creating a likely fish passage barrier. Approximately 400m upstream, the stream transitioned to a beaver-impounded area with four consecutive 1–1.5m high dams holding back a large volume of water, but flow over or under allowed possible fish passage. The impoundment area extended as far as the surveyed area. A fish (~40mm) was observed after the second beaver dam. The top of the site was marked at WP 400. 199328 Scotch Creek Gala Bay Road MoTi 388380 5996779 10 – – Medium – 199204 Nine Mile Creek Settlement Road MOTI 403906 5998777 10 RB 24.1 Medium The stream was a larger system with significant beaver activity, creating impoundments behind dams ranging from 0.3 to 1.5m in height. Heavy cattle use was evident in riparian areas, with trampled banks, extensive browsing of riparian shrubs, and a significant amount of manure within seasonally inundated areas. The survey extended from Settlement Road to a large beaver dam and impoundment. Nutrient loading to the stream appeared high, with large amounts of algae present on the primarily gravel substrates in sections of the channel linking beaver-impounded areas. 199190 Clear Creek Highway 27 MOTI 425557 5996165 10 LKC;LSU 6.2 Medium The stream had good flow and provided high-quality habitat for the first 100m before beginning to run subsurface. At approximately 200m upstream of the highway, adjacent to a quarry, the stream was fully dewatered to the top of the site. The channel was highly confined and lacked complexity. Although some small and large woody debris were present, they did not appear to function in creating habitat during periods of flow. The stream was primarily a straight channel with a coarse cobble and boulder substrate. A large pile of riprap was placed at the culvert outlet, possibly to reduce the outlet drop, though its placement appeared unusual and could inhibit fish passage. 199232 Beaverley Creek Highway 16 MOti 502374 5962501 10 BB;CAS;CBC;CH;CSU;DV;KO;LNC;LSU;MW;NSC;PCC;RB;RSC;SU 43.1 Medium A large stream with abundant gravels suitable for Chinook spawning. Pools were infrequent, primarily located on outside bends and behind large woody debris. Some evidence of anthropogenic manipulation was observed, including cut cottonwood trees that had fallen into the channel. The riparian zone was in good condition, with mature shrub communities and old-growth cottonwood that should contribute to future habitat complexity. The culvert appeared to have been modified in the past to attempt backwatering, with boulder lines present downstream. Heavy rainfall over the previous evening and preceding weeks had raised water levels to moderate conditions. The stream was a major tributary to the Chilako River, with documented Chinook presence. The watershed was within Prince George city limits, presenting opportunities for community engagement, trail network development, educational programs, and stewardship initiatives. A significant slump on the highway approximately 300m upstream of the culvert was actively eroding; however, a healthy young deciduous and shrub-dominated riparian zone at this location likely provided some filtration and protection of water quality. 199256 Kenneth Creek Highway 16 MOTI 582279 5975090 10 BT;CC;CCG;CH;LSU;RB 71.6 High The stream was large and gravel-dominated, with extensive deep runs, deep pools, large woody debris, and multiple channels throughout. Gravels were suitable for Chinook and resident salmonid spawning. A Chinook spawner was observed upstream of the culvert in 2022. Heavy rains over the past two weeks had significantly raised water levels. A beaver dam was present within side channels at the upper end of the surveyed site. The riparian area was intact throughout, consisting of a mix of shrub-dominated wetland areas and mature mixed forest. 199260 Tributary To Sugarbowl Creek Highway 16 MOTI 587916 5972449 10 – 0.0 High The stream was a larger, steeper system with intact, mature coniferous cedar-hemlock riparian cover, primarily stable banks, and abundant large woody debris throughout. A step-pool morphology was present, with pools up to 80cm deep. Numerous debris jam steps ranged from 30–60cm. Habitat appeared suitable for large bull trout spawning and rearing. 199255 Tributary To Kenneth Creek Bowron FSR MoF 578664 5972996 10 LSU 0.8 Medium Small stream with good flow and abundant gravels suitable for bull trout and cutthroat trout spawning. Occasional shallow pools provided habitat for juvenile salmonid rearing. Banks were stable, with an intact mixed mature forest. The stream had some short sections with gradients up to 5% but was primarily a low-gradient riffle-gravel system. 199267 Driscoll Creek Highway 16 MoTi 606378 5965782 10 CCG;RB 8.2 Medium The stream was a low-gradient, gravel-dominated system with an extensive shrub-sedge wetland area and beaver activity in the lower 200m. Deep pools up to 1m were present throughout, influenced by abundant large woody debris contributed from the adjacent mature, primarily coniferous forest. The stream was surveyed for 600m upstream of the highway, and the west fork was surveyed. 199237 Snowshoe Creek Highway 16 MoTi 650786 5934862 10 EB;LKC;RB;RSC;ST 22.3 High The stream was surveyed upstream for 750m, following the west fork at the junction. The east fork was surveyed separately (13900100_us2). The stream was a large, low-gradient gravel riffle-pool system with abundant large woody debris throughout. Banks were stable, with an intact mature coniferous riparian zone. High flows due to heavy rains over the past two weeks made pool delineation difficult, so residual depth was estimated. Gravel and small cobbles were present, likely suitable for Chinook spawning. Extensive areas of high-value habitat were observed for juvenile rearing and resident salmonid spawning. 199174 Tributary To Nechako River Sutherland FSR MoF 397160 5996574 10 SP 0.0 – Medium-value habitat. The stream had been heavily impacted by cattle throughout the surveyed area, with evidence of bank trampling and extensive low-gradient muddy sections. Upstream of the culvert, the stream was primarily dry for the first 300m, with young forest and shrubs. At this point, intermittent pools began to appear, associated with beaver activity. At approximately 450–500m upstream, the stream became almost entirely watered, with pools up to 40cm deep. Many surveyed areas resembled wetland habitat, with spirea, willow, alder, and trembling aspen throughout. The last 200m of the stream was incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, as it flowed more directly southeast to join the Nechako River rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River. 199173 Tributary To Nechako River Dog Creek Road MOTI 398923 5996362 10 SP 0.0 Medium Heavy cattle impacts were observed throughout the surveyed area, with the most pronounced damage in low-gradient sections with easily accessible banks. The stream changed character at a beaver dam located approximately 300–350m upstream, transitioning from a channelized stream to beaver-impounded wetland areas. A fence intended to restrict cattle access had been breached. A series of beaver dams began approximately 300m upstream of the road, with over three dams observed, some up to 1.5m high. The dams were mature, well-developed, and had vegetation growing through them. Fish were observed throughout the survey area. The habitat was of medium value for rearing rainbow trout and potentially Chinook, with some pockets of gravels present. However, heavy cattle impacts had led to significant sedimentation, with fines covering much of the substrate. The beaver dams were impounding large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow downstream at the Dog Creek Road crossing. Waypoints were taken for a breached fence line (WP 32), a slumped historic road (WP 33), and the first beaver dam (WP 34). The last 200m of the stream was incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, as it flowed more directly southeast to join the Nechako River rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River. 199282 Holliday Creek Highway 16 MOTI 305946 5896010 11 – 3.3 High A large glaciated system with a cobble-boulder substrate and an intact mixed riparian zone, primarily deciduous. Occasional large woody debris features created deep pool habitats and likely gravel tailouts. The system had a lower gradient, with occasional pockets of gravels suitable for spawning salmonids ranging from 20cm to 100cm in size. 199278 Teepee Creek Highway 5 MOTI 344031 5862744 11 SA 0.0 High The stream was surveyed from the highway to the railway and was a mid-sized, steeper cobble-boulder step-pool system with only rare pockets of unembedded gravels. Deep pools were present, formed by boulder and large woody debris scour. A salmon point was noted near the pipeline location in FISS. Numerous small steps ranging from 30–60cm were present due to the steep, boulder-dominated nature of the stream. – Teepee Creek Railway CN Rail 344222 5862742 11 – – Medium – fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary(dat = pscis_phase2) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Summary of Phase 2 fish passage reassessments.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 4.6: Summary of Phase 2 fish passage reassessments.

The stream was highly channelized due to residential properties on both sides. The habitat was rated as medium with minimal cover and few pools suitable for fish, but gravels were present for spawning. Anecdotal information from a neighboring landowner suggested the stream below Gala Bay Road had been diverted to accommodate a driveway for a recreational property. The average channel width was 2.4m, the average wetted width was 1.4m, and the average gradient was 1.3%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199171 and Downstream of Crossing 7622 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199171 for 275m , all the way to crossing 7622 on Stella Road (Figure 4.4). The habitat was rated as medium value, with good flow and abundant gravels, flowing through several private properties with newly established quad and foot traffic trails. Pools were limited and predominantly shallow. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 2.4m, the average wetted width was 1.2m, and the average gradient was 4.5%. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 7622 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 7622 for 500m (Figure 4.5). The habitat was rated as high value with relatively steep gradients and abundant functional large woody debris creating steps and pools 20–30mm deep. In some sections, the stream widened and became shallow, with abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Overhead cover was extensive. Near the upper end of the site, the forest had been cleared for pipeline use, resulting in significant bank erosion and ripirian removal (Figure 4.6).. A large pipe crossed the stream near the pipeline corridor. Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 3.5m, the average wetted width was 1.4m, and the average gradient was 7%.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Gala Bay Road crossing (199171) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. This culvert had a 0.9m outlet drop, very likely inhibiting fish passage. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 1,500,000.

The habitat was rated as medium value. The stream had been channelized with riprap at the upstream end of the survey and near the downstream lake. On the lakeside, the left bank was a mix of forest and recreational property lawns. A historic Chinook point was recorded near the culvert at Gala Bay Road. Some type of bloom was observed along the lake shoreline (Figure 4.8).. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as .The average channel width was 2.9m, the average wetted width was 1.6m, and the average gradient was 1.8%.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199328 and Downstream of Crossing 199172 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199328 on Gala Bay Road upstream to crossing 199172 on Stella Road, a distance of approximately 270m (Figure 4.9). The habitat was rated as medium value with limited pools, however abundant overhanging vegetation and small woody debris provided cover and gravels suitable for resident salmonid spawning were present. The average channel width was 2.1m, the average wetted width was 1.3m, and the average gradient was 3%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant. Incision was evident, beginning with a deep cut at the culvert outlet under Stella Road and continuing downstream to Gala Bay Road. The riparian area was generally intact throughout most of the stream, except for the downstream 75m, where private land development on the north side had resulted in a lawn and riparian vegetation removal up to the channel edge. A historic Chinook point near Gala Bay Road may have resulted from a past salvage operation. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199172 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199172 for 550m (Figure 4.10). The habitat was rated as medium value with abundant functional large woody debris creating occasional pools 20–30mm deep, suitable for overwintering juvenile fish. Overhead cover was extensive, and occasional gravels were suitable for spawning. Approximately 400m upstream of Stella Road, the stream transitioned to a beaver-impounded area with four consecutive 1–1.5m high dams holding back a large volume of water, but flow over or under allowed possible fish passage. The impounded area extended as far as the surveyed area. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 2.6m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 4.3%. A fish (~40mm) was observed after the second beaver dam. PSCIS crossing 203297 was located 150m upstream of Stella Road on private property, where the culvert had a significant outlet drop and severe erosion, creating a fish passage barrier. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate A the time of reporting in 2025, crossing 199328 on Gala Bay Road was ranked as passable to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol and no remediation is required (MoE 2011). Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Stella Road crossing (199172) with a bridge (18 m span) is recommended.

Crossing 199173 is located 115m upstream of the Nechako River, on Dog Creek Road, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1794340). Approximately 2km upstream, PSCIS crossing 199174 is located on Sutherland FSR and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Forests. The last 200m of the stream was incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, as it flowed more directly southeast to join the Nechako River rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River. Both crossings are within the Nechako River watershed group. Background At this location, Tributary To Nechako River is a third order stream and drains a watershed of approximately 15km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1191m to 680m near the crossing (Table 4.20). In 2023, crossings 199173 and 199174 were assessed with fish passage assessments. These sites were prioritized for follow-up with habitat confirmation assessments due to the presence of high-value habitat observed upstream and fish observed during the 2023 assessment.

Comments: The culvert had a moderate outlet drop with some erosion around the pipe at the outlet. The pipe was in good condition. The stream provided excellent habitat, with several pools and abundant undercut banks. Fish were observed during the assessment (~40‚Äì90mm in length). Upstream of the crossing, the stream was channelized with some pockets of gravel suitable for rearing rainbow trout and potentially Chinook. It then transitioned into beaver-impounded wetland areas storing large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow at this crossing. There was extensive cattle trampling around the inlet of the pipe and throughout the surveyed upstream area. The crossing was located approximately 150m upstream from the Nechako River mainstem.

Comments: At the time of assessment, the stream was dry at the crossing; however, it contained medium-value habitat. Upstream of the culvert, the stream was primarily dry for the first 300m, then intermittent pools began to appear, associated with beaver activity. Approximately 450‚Äì500m upstream, the stream became nearly fully watered, with pools up to 40cm deep. Downstream of the crossing was dominated by beaver-impounded wetland areas, which were storing large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow at the downstream crossing on Dog Creek Road. Further downstream, approximately 300m upstream of the crossing on Dog Creek Road, the stream transitioned to a channelized system with some pockets of gravel suitable for rearing rainbow trout and potentially Chinook. However, heavy cattle impacts were observed at both this crossing and the downstream crossing on Dog Creek Road. ##this is useful to get some comments for the report hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site &amp; location == &#39;ds&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site &amp; location == &#39;us&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site2 &amp; location == &#39;ds&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site2 &amp; location == &#39;us&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing 199173 The stream was surveyed downstream from crossing 199173 for 115m (Figure 4.11)..

The dominant substrate was cobbles with fines sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and boulders.The average channel width was 3.5m, the average wetted width was 1.3m, and the average gradient was 6%.. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199173 and Downstream of Crossing 199174 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199173 for 575m (Figure 4.12). The habitat was rated as medium with some pockets of gravels present suitable for rainbow trout and potentially Chinook rearing. Fish were observed throughout the area surveyed. Heavy cattle impacts were observed throughout the surveyed area, with the most pronounced damage in low-gradient sections with easily accessible banks. The stream changed character at a beaver dam located approximately 300–350m upstream, transitioning from a channelized stream to beaver-impounded wetland areas. A fence intended to restrict cattle access had been breached. A series of beaver dams began approximately 300m upstream of the road, with over three dams observed, some up to 1.5m high. The dams were mature, well-developed, and had vegetation growing through them. The beaver dams were impounding large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow downstream at the Dog Creek Road crossing. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 3m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 2.4%. The stream was surveyed downstream from crossing 199174 for 300m (Figure 4.13). The stream was intermittent for the first ~70m before transitioning into a beaver-impacted wetland area. Approximately 250m downstream of Sutherland Road, several large consecutive mature beaver dams were present and appeared to continue as far as the area surveyed. Signs of cattle trampling were observed throughout the stream, and the channel frequently split into several smaller channels. The habitat was rated as medium, with few gravels for spawning but abundant pools created by beaver dams. The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 2m, the average wetted width was 1m, and the average gradient was 1.2%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199174 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199174 for 650m (Figure 4.14). The habitat was rated as medium value and had been heavily impacted by cattle throughout the surveyed area, with evidence of bank trampling and extensive low-gradient muddy sections. Upstream of the culvert, the stream was primarily dry for the first 300m, with young forest and shrubs. At this point, intermittent pools began to appear, associated with beaver activity. At approximately 450–500m upstream, the stream became almost entirely watered, with pools up to 40cm deep. Many surveyed areas resembled wetland habitat, with spirea, willow, alder, and trembling aspen throughout. The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 2.5m, the average wetted width was 0.9m, and the average gradient was 1.2%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and overhanging vegetation. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Dog Creek Road crossing (199173) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 1,500,000. At the time of assessment, the upstream crossing on Sutherland FSR was unlikely a barrier to fish passage, and restoration efforts should prioritize the upstream crossing on Dog Creek Road. However, should restoration activities proceed at crossing 199174, replacement with a bridge spanning 15 m is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the estimated cost for the replacement is $ 450,000.

Comments: The inlets of both culverts were dammed by a beaver, backing up water to most of the culverts’ height. Two pipes, each 1.6m in diameter, were present. A large outlet pool indicated the pipes were likely undersized for the stream. Another beaver dam was being constructed at the outlet of the pool. The dirt road had minimal road fill, making construction relatively straightforward. The road appeared to be used for pipeline access. Outlet pool depth was estimated as it was too deep to wade. Fish approximately 40mm in length were observed downstream during habitat confirmation.

Comments: The inlet of the culvert was completely submerged, with a large beaver pond area just upstream. The outlet was plugged with beaver sticks, and it appeared the beaver had dammed the culvert entirely, creating a large pool at the inlet. Despite this, the culvert still had flow. A beaver dam approximately 0.7m in height was located about 40m downstream. A new culvert had been installed 60m north on the FSR, with flow from that crossing entering the outlet pool from the north. Downstream of the culvert, the stream flowed through the forest with minimal defined channel. Where a defined channel was present, it ranged from 1‚Äì3m wide, but most of the area consisted of 15‚Äì17m of wetted forest with some flow. Culvert slope was estimated due to the submerged inlet.

Crossing 199278 is located 2.4km upstream of the McLennan River, on Highway 5, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id:1467202). Approximately 300m upstream, PSCIS crossing 203302 is located on and is the responsibility of the CN Railway. Both crossings are within the Upper Fraser River watershed group. Background At this location, Teepee Creek is a third order stream and drains a high elevation watershed of approximately 11km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 2648m to 798m near the crossing (Table 4.57). In 2023, crossing 199278 was assessed with a fish passage assessments. This site was prioritized for follow-up with habitat confirmation assessments due to the presence of high-value habitat observed upstream during the 2023 assessment.

Stream Characteristics at Crossings 199278 and 203302 At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing 199278 on Highway 5 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 4.59). The culvert had a moderate 0.4m outlet drop. PSCIS crossing 203302 on the CN Railway was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 4.60). This culvert had a significant 0.75m outlet drop. In 2024, two other nearby PSCIS crossings were reassessed on Teepee Creek [LINK_APPENDIX_1]. Approximately 700m downstream of the Highway 5, PSCIS crossing 7620 was located on the CN Railway. Although the crossing ranked was as barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011), the culvert was embedded, 100% backwatered, and was not a barrier to fish passage at the time of the survey. Approximately 600m downstream of PSCIS crossing 203302 on the CN Railway, PSCIS crossing 4931 was located on Mount Tinsley Pit Road, which falls under the road tenure of Carrier Lumber R13564. The culvert had a significant 1.3m outlet drop.

Comments: A moderate outlet drop was present and would be substantial at lower flows. Flow was steady at the time of assessment. The culvert was in good condition. A large, deep outlet pool indicated the culvert was likely undersized for the stream. Additionally, minimal road fill made this crossing a significant flood hazard, which could wash out Highway 5. Downstream, the stream had frequent pools 0.3‚Äì0.5m deep, providing good overwintering habitat for fish, and abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Roughly 150m downstream of the culvert, several cattle pens crossed the stream and appeared to be set up to provide cattle access for drinking. These areas were visibly trampled, with significant loss of riparian vegetation. Upstream, the stream was relatively confined, with only rare pockets of unembedded gravels. Deep pools were present, formed by boulder and large woody debris scour. A salmon point was noted near the pipeline location in FISS. Numerous small steps, ranging from 30‚Äì60cm, were present due to the steep, boulder-dominated nature of the stream. Electrofishing would be beneficial for further assessment. The site was a highway crossing, making replacement difficult. A small ford was located approximately 5m downstream of the culvert outlet.
