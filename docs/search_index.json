"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Since 2023, the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc), with funding from the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, has been actively involved in planning, coordinating, and conducting fish passage restoration efforts within the Upper Fraser River watershed. The primary objective of this project is to identify and prioritize fish passage barriers within these study areas, develop comprehensive restoration plans to address these barriers, and foster momentum for broader ecosystem restoration initiatives. While the primary focus is on fish passage, this work also serves as a lens through which to view the broader ecosystems, leveraging efforts to build capacity for ecosystem restoration and improving our understanding of watershed health. We recognize that the health of life - such as our own - and the health of our surroundings are interconnected, with our overall well-being dependent on the health of our environment. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.

Their traditional territory stretches from north of Mcbride, all the way south to Barrier, and east to Mt.Robson Provincial Park, and includes the North Thompson River and the Upper Fraser River (“About Us – Simpcw” n.d.). 2.3 Lheidli T’enneh The Lheidli T’enneh First Nations are a Dakelh sub-group whose traditional territory encompasses the Nechako River, Upper Fraser River, and Morkill River, spanning from west of Prince George to Valemount. “Lheidli” translates to “The People from the Confluence of the River,” referring to the meeting of the Nechako (“Nee Incha Koh” – “river with strong undercurrents”) and Fraser (“Ltha Koh” – “Big Mouth River”) rivers in what is now Prince George, British Columbia (“Our Story - Lheidli T’enneh | First Nation | Prince George, BC” 2020). Located within the traditional territory of the Lheidli T’enneh is Chun T’oh Whudujut (Ancient Forest), a Provincial Park and Protected Area 120km east of Prince George. The park has thousand-year-old western red cedars and a rich biodiversity of plants, mosses, lichens and fungi which can be explored through the trail network. Historically, Lheidli people would visit the stands from summer fishing camps along the upper Fraser River as well as gather medicinal plants, some of which were thought to be extinct. However, the park was not always a protected area and was initially slated for logging until a UNBC graduate student studying lichen biodiversity identified the ancient stands of western red cedars. Recognizing their ecological and cultural significance, trails were developed to highlight the cedars and advocate for their protection. Through partnerships with local hiking groups, UNBC, Lheidli T’enneh, and the Provincial Government, the Ancient Forest biodiversity assessment project has contributed to conservation efforts and tourism-based economic development in the Prince George area (“Ancient Forest - Lheidli T’enneh | First Nation | Prince George, BC” 2020). 2.4 Carrier Sekani The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council unifies six nations west of Price George: the Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation (Burns Lake Band), Nadleh Whut’en First Nation, Saik’uz First Nation, Stellat’en First Nation, Takla Nation, and Wet’suwet’en First Nation (“About CSTC and the CSFNs” n.d.; “Simpcw First Nation History” n.d.), and inlcudes the Nechako and Chilako Rivers. 2.5 Lhtakoh Known as the Ltha Koh, meaning “rivers within one another” to the Dakelh (Carrier) people, the Fraser River stretches nearly 1,400 kilometers from the Rocky Mountains of Mount Robson Provincial Park to the Strait of Georgia near Vancouver. As the largest salmon-producing river on Canada’s west coast (Bradford and Taylor 2023; “Dakleh Placenames” n.d.), it plays a crucial economic role in supporting forestry, agriculture, and hydroelectric power generation. Additionally, the Fraser River is vital for fisheries, especially for salmon populations, which are essential to both the local ecosystem and indigenous communities. The Upper Fraser River is commonly defined as the section of the mainstem north of Quesnel, flowing through the Cariboo and Fraser Plateau regions. Major tributaries include the Nechako, Quesnel, and McGregor rivers (D. P. Shaw and Tuominen, n.d.). This vast expanse supports many indigenous groups who utilize the land for cultural, spiritual, and economic practices. The Upper Fraser River, an 8th order stream, drains an area of 232,134 km2 upstream of the McGregor River confluence. The seasonal hydrograph has a single broad peak in early summer due to snow and glacial melt from surrounding mountain ranges (Figure 2.2). The mean annual discharge at station 08KA005 in McBride, located roughly 200km southeast of Prince George, is 200.9 m3/. sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08KA005&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08KA005.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Fraser River At Mcbride (Station #08KA005 - Lat 53.30172 Lon -120.14092).

Beginning at the Nechako Plateau, it flows north towards Fort Fraser then east to its confluence with the Fraser River in Prince George. The Nachako River has three main tributaries: the Stuart River, the Endako River, and the Chilako River. It has a mean annual discharge of 141.3 m3/s at station 08JC001 located in Vanderhoof and 278.5 m3/s at station 08JC002 located in Isle Pierre, ~25km downstream of the Stuart River confluence. Flow patterns at Isle Pierre are heavily influenced by inflows from the Stuart River (enters downstream of Vanderhoof) resulting in higher peak levels and average discharge (Figure 2.3). The hygrograph at station 08JC001 in Vanderhoof peaks in June and August, with lower peak levels and average discharge (Figure 2.3). The Nechako River, meaning “Blackwater people’s river”, is home to the Cheslatta Carrier Nation who are part of the Dakelh people. Traditionally, they lived off the land near Tsetl’adak Bunk’ut “Peak Rock Lake” (Cheslatta Lake), however, in 1952, the construction of the Kenney Dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) and the subsequent flooding of the Nechako Reservoir forced the Cheslatta Carrier people to abandon their ancestral lands (“The History of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation” n.d.; “Dakleh Placenames” n.d.). This relocation was done with little notice or compensation, causing significant disruptions to their community, culture, and way of life. Despite these challenges, the Cheslatta Carrier Nation has worked to preserve their cultural heritage and advocate for their rights and land restoration. hydat_stations &lt;- fpr::fpr_db_query(query = lfpr_dbq_clip(&#39;whse_environmental_monitoring.envcan_hydrometric_stn_sp&#39;, &#39;whse_basemapping.fwa_watershed_groups_poly&#39;, &#39;watershed_group_code&#39;, c(&quot;FRAN&quot;, &quot;LCHL&quot;,&quot;NECR&quot;))) # Use if you want to create a hydrograph for a each station, won&#39;t print captions though hydat_stations %&gt;% dplyr::filter(station_operating_status == &quot;ACTIVE-REALTIME&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(!(station_number == &#39;08JB007&#39;)) %&gt;% pull(station_number) %&gt;% lapply(fpr_create_hydrograph_local) # starting at 1948 because that&#39;s where consistent data starts sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08JC001&quot;, start_year = 1948) sfpr_create_hydrograph(&quot;08JC002&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08JC001.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08JC002.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Hydrograph for Nechako River at Vanderhoof (Station #08JC001)(left) and at Isle Pierre (Station #08JC002)(right). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08JC002.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08JC001.png&quot;) 2.7 Endako River The Endako River is a 6th order stream that flows south east from Burns Lake to Fraser Lake.

Records from the following datasets have been included: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS); the Fish Habitat Inventory and Information Program (FHIIP); the Field Data Information System (FDIS) and the Resource Analysis Branch (RAB) inventory studies. The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known. It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage. This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species. whse_fish.fiss_stream_sample_sites_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e616864b-8991-42d1-a2f9-4d4402c32be8 This spatial layer displays stream inventory sample sites that have had full or partial surveys, and contains measurements or indicator information of the data collected at each survey site on each date. whse_fish.pscis_assessment_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/7ecfafa6-5e18-48cd-8d9b-eae5b5ea2881 Points where a fish passage assessment has been performed on a stream crossing structure.

Design points have been identified as a priority for remediation based on a variety of potential criteria: quality of habitat upstream, quantity of fish habitat upstream, number and importance of species present, operational plans for the road cost of the proposed remediation, etc. They are sites where the amount of habitat to be gained by remediation has been confirmed and where a design has actually been completed. whse_fish.pscis_habitat_confirmation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/572595ab-0a25-452a-a857-1b6bb9c30495 Points where an evaluation of the fish habitat up and downstream of a road crossing have been carried out. Phase 2 of 4 in the Fish Passage Workflow, Habitat Confirmations are done at sites where the crossing structure is known to be a failure. The Habitat Confirmation is performed to ensure that the site in question is a good candidate for moving on to the Design (Phase 3) and Remediation (Phase 4) stages of the workflow. The Habitat Confirmation confirms the crossing is a barrier, places the crossing in context with respect to other roads and crossings in the watershed and also quantifies and qualifies how much habitat will be gained if the site is fixed. whse_fish.pscis_remediation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/1596afbf-f427-4f26-9bca-d78bceddf485 Points where a barrier to fish passage has been rectified or remediated.

Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. The post-fire imagery is acquired during the subsequent growing season. Mapping conducted during the subsequent growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th. Please note, this layer is 1-year-later burn severity dataset. The same-year burn severity mapping dataset (WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SAME_YR_SP) is considered an interim product to this layer. 3.2.0.1 Methodology: • Select suitable pre- and post-fire imagery or create a cloud/snow/smoke-free composite from multiple images scenes • Calculate normalized burn severity ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire images • Calculate difference NBR (dNBR) where dNBR = pre NBR – post NBR • Apply a scaling equation (dNBR_scaled = dNBR*1000 + 275)/5) • Apply BARC thresholds (76, 110, 187) to create a 4-class image (unburned, low severity, medium severity, and high severity) • Apply region-based filters to reduce noise • Confirm burn severity analysis results through visual quality control • Produce a vector dataset and apply E whse_imagery_and_base_maps.aimg_orthophoto_tiles_poly https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/60d873d3-2e91-4c56-8e30-e5cb2872d1f8 A set of polygons representing the geographic coverage of all individual orthophotos from the provincial collection that are available for sale to the public. whse_imagery_and_base_maps.mot_culverts_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/89d44ba6-7236-48ed-afab-f25a98c846ef A Culvert is a pipe (less than 3m in diameter) or half-round flume used to transport or drain water under or away from the road and/or right of way.

In the event of a discrepancy in the data, the metes and bounds description will prevail. Although the boundaries were drawn based on the legal metes and bounds descriptions, they may differ from how regional districts and their member municipalities and electoral areas currently view and/or manage their boundaries. Where discrepancies are noted, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (the custodian) enters into discussion with the local governments whose boundaries are affected. In order to effect a change to the boundary, Cabinet approval is required. This is done through an Order in Council (OIC). While discrepancies to administrative boundaries are being resolved, boundaries may be adjusted on an ongoing basis until the requested changes are completed. The OIC_YEAR and OIC_NUMBER fields indicate the year that the boundary was passed under OIC and its associated number.

A total of 177 Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessments were completed. During the 2024 field season, field assessments were conducted between October 04, 2024 and October 09, 2024 by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio. and Lucy Schick, B.Sc. A total of 9 Fish Passage Assessments were completed, including 7 Phase 1 assessments and 2 reassessments. Of the 186 sites where fish passage assessments were completed, 184 were not yet inventoried in the PSCIS system. This included 20 crossings considered “passable”, 31 crossings considered “potential” barriers, and 128 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011). Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 5 crossings assessed were fords and were ranked as “unknown” according to the provincial protocol. Reassessments were completed at 2 sites where PSICS data required updating. A summary of crossings assessed, a rough cost estimate for remediation, and a priority ranking for follow-up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table ??. Detailed data with photos are presented in [Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos]. The “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed MoE (2011) and represent an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout under any flow conditions that may occur throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and O’Hanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; E. A. Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. tab_cost_est_phase1 |&gt; select(`PSCIS ID`:`Cost Est ( $K)`) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments ranked as a &#39;barrier&#39; or &#39;potential&#39; barrier. &quot;, sp_network_caption), scroll = gitbook_on) 3.4 Phase 2 - Habitat Confirmation Assessments During the 2024 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 13 sites within the Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, Upper Fraser River, Morkill River, and Francois Lake watershed groups. A total of approximately 14 km of stream was assessed. Georeferenced field maps are provided in Attachment 1. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. Results are summarized in Figure ?? and Tables 3.4 - ?? with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in Attachment 2. A summary of preliminary modeling results illustrates the estimated Chinook, coho, and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing, based on measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length, as presented in Figure 3.1.

Chinook rearing model used for habitat estimates (total length of stream network PSCIS ID Stream Road Tenure UTM UTM zone Fish Species Habitat Gain (km) Habitat Value Comments 7622 Burnt Cabin Creek Stella Road MoTI 388735 5997152 10 – 0.0 Medium A high-quality stream with a relatively steep gradient and abundant functional large woody debris creating steps and pools 20–30mm deep. In some sections, the stream widened and became shallow, with abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Overhead cover was extensive. Near the upper end of the site, the forest had been cleared for pipeline use, resulting in significant bank erosion. and ripiran removal. A large pipe crossed the stream near the pipeline corridor. The stream was surveyed from Stella Road up to the pipeline, ~500m. 199171 Burnt Cabin Creek Gala Bay Road MOTI 388944 5997001 10 – 0.0 Medium A small stream with good flow and abundant gravels, flowing through several private properties with newly established quad and foot traffic trails. Pools were limited and predominantly shallow. A significant outlet drop was present at the downstream culvert on Gala Bay Road, while the upstream culvert on Stella Road had an even larger drop, both indicating the pipes were undersized for the watershed’s flow capacity. Anecdotal information from a neighboring landowner suggested the stream below Gala Bay Road had been diverted to accommodate a driveway for a recreational property. 199172 Scotch Creek Stella Road MoTi 388269 5996948 10 – 0.0 Medium The stream provided excellent habitat, with abundant functional large woody debris creating occasional pools 20–30mm deep, suitable for overwintering juvenile fish. Overhead cover was extensive, and occasional gravels were suitable for spawning. A small, broken plastic pipe was present in the first 150m upstream of the culvert, likely a former water intake for adjacent properties. PSCIS crossing 203297 was located 150m upstream of Stella Road on private property, where the culvert had a significant outlet drop, creating a likely fish passage barrier. Approximately 400m upstream, the stream transitioned to a beaver-impounded area with four consecutive 1–1.5m high dams holding back a large volume of water, but flow over or under allowed possible fish passage. The impoundment area extended as far as the surveyed area. A fish (~40mm) was observed after the second beaver dam. The top of the site was marked at WP 400. 199328 Scotch Creek Gala Bay Road MoTi 388380 5996779 10 – – Medium – 199204 Nine Mile Creek Settlement Road MOTI 403906 5998777 10 RB 24.1 Medium The stream was a larger system with significant beaver activity, creating impoundments behind dams ranging from 0.3 to 1.5m in height. Heavy cattle use was evident in riparian areas, with trampled banks, extensive browsing of riparian shrubs, and a significant amount of manure within seasonally inundated areas. The survey extended from Settlement Road to a large beaver dam and impoundment. Nutrient loading to the stream appeared high, with large amounts of algae present on the primarily gravel substrates in sections of the channel linking beaver-impounded areas. 199190 Clear Creek Highway 27 MOTI 425557 5996165 10 LKC;LSU 6.2 Medium The stream had good flow and provided high-quality habitat for the first 100m before beginning to run subsurface. At approximately 200m upstream of the highway, adjacent to a quarry, the stream was fully dewatered to the top of the site. The channel was highly confined and lacked complexity. Although some small and large woody debris were present, they did not appear to function in creating habitat during periods of flow. The stream was primarily a straight channel with a coarse cobble and boulder substrate. A large pile of riprap was placed at the culvert outlet, possibly to reduce the outlet drop, though its placement appeared unusual and could inhibit fish passage. 199232 Beaverley Creek Highway 16 MOti 502374 5962501 10 BB;CAS;CBC;CH;CSU;DV;KO;LNC;LSU;MW;NSC;PCC;RB;RSC;SU 43.1 Medium A large stream with abundant gravels suitable for Chinook spawning. Pools were infrequent, primarily located on outside bends and behind large woody debris. Some evidence of anthropogenic manipulation was observed, including cut cottonwood trees that had fallen into the channel. The riparian zone was in good condition, with mature shrub communities and old-growth cottonwood that should contribute to future habitat complexity. The culvert appeared to have been modified in the past to attempt backwatering, with boulder lines present downstream. Heavy rainfall over the previous evening and preceding weeks had raised water levels to moderate conditions. The stream was a major tributary to the Chilako River, with documented Chinook presence. The watershed was within Prince George city limits, presenting opportunities for community engagement, trail network development, educational programs, and stewardship initiatives. A significant slump on the highway approximately 300m upstream of the culvert was actively eroding; however, a healthy young deciduous and shrub-dominated riparian zone at this location likely provided some filtration and protection of water quality. 199256 Kenneth Creek Highway 16 MOTI 582279 5975090 10 BT;CC;CCG;CH;LSU;RB 71.6 High The stream was large and gravel-dominated, with extensive deep runs, deep pools, large woody debris, and multiple channels throughout. Gravels were suitable for Chinook and resident salmonid spawning. A Chinook spawner was observed upstream of the culvert in 2022. Heavy rains over the past two weeks had significantly raised water levels. A beaver dam was present within side channels at the upper end of the surveyed site. The riparian area was intact throughout, consisting of a mix of shrub-dominated wetland areas and mature mixed forest. 199260 Tributary To Sugarbowl Creek Highway 16 MOTI 587916 5972449 10 – 0.0 High The stream was a larger, steeper system with intact, mature coniferous cedar-hemlock riparian cover, primarily stable banks, and abundant large woody debris throughout. A step-pool morphology was present, with pools up to 80cm deep. Numerous debris jam steps ranged from 30–60cm. Habitat appeared suitable for large bull trout spawning and rearing. 199255 Tributary To Kenneth Creek Bowron FSR MoF 578664 5972996 10 LSU 0.8 Medium Small stream with good flow and abundant gravels suitable for bull trout and cutthroat trout spawning. Occasional shallow pools provided habitat for juvenile salmonid rearing. Banks were stable, with an intact mixed mature forest. The stream had some short sections with gradients up to 5% but was primarily a low-gradient riffle-gravel system. 199267 Driscoll Creek Highway 16 MoTi 606378 5965782 10 CCG;RB 8.2 Medium The stream was a low-gradient, gravel-dominated system with an extensive shrub-sedge wetland area and beaver activity in the lower 200m. Deep pools up to 1m were present throughout, influenced by abundant large woody debris contributed from the adjacent mature, primarily coniferous forest. The stream was surveyed for 600m upstream of the highway, and the west fork was surveyed. 199237 Snowshoe Creek Highway 16 MoTi 650786 5934862 10 EB;LKC;RB;RSC;ST 22.3 High The stream was surveyed upstream for 750m, following the west fork at the junction. The east fork was surveyed separately (13900100_us2). The stream was a large, low-gradient gravel riffle-pool system with abundant large woody debris throughout. Banks were stable, with an intact mature coniferous riparian zone. High flows due to heavy rains over the past two weeks made pool delineation difficult, so residual depth was estimated. Gravel and small cobbles were present, likely suitable for Chinook spawning. Extensive areas of high-value habitat were observed for juvenile rearing and resident salmonid spawning. 199174 Tributary To Nechako River Sutherland FSR MoF 397160 5996574 10 SP 0.0 – Medium-value habitat. The stream had been heavily impacted by cattle throughout the surveyed area, with evidence of bank trampling and extensive low-gradient muddy sections. Upstream of the culvert, the stream was primarily dry for the first 300m, with young forest and shrubs. At this point, intermittent pools began to appear, associated with beaver activity. At approximately 450–500m upstream, the stream became almost entirely watered, with pools up to 40cm deep. Many surveyed areas resembled wetland habitat, with spirea, willow, alder, and trembling aspen throughout. The last 200m of the stream was incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, as it flowed more directly southeast to join the Nechako River rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River. 199173 Tributary To Nechako River Dog Creek Road MOTI 398923 5996362 10 SP 0.0 Medium Heavy cattle impacts were observed throughout the surveyed area, with the most pronounced damage in low-gradient sections with easily accessible banks. The stream changed character at a beaver dam located approximately 300–350m upstream, transitioning from a channelized stream to beaver-impounded wetland areas. A fence intended to restrict cattle access had been breached. A series of beaver dams began approximately 300m upstream of the road, with over three dams observed, some up to 1.5m high. The dams were mature, well-developed, and had vegetation growing through them. Fish were observed throughout the survey area. The habitat was of medium value for rearing rainbow trout and potentially Chinook, with some pockets of gravels present. However, heavy cattle impacts had led to significant sedimentation, with fines covering much of the substrate. The beaver dams were impounding large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow downstream at the Dog Creek Road crossing. Waypoints were taken for a breached fence line (WP 32), a slumped historic road (WP 33), and the first beaver dam (WP 34). The last 200m of the stream was incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, as it flowed more directly southeast to join the Nechako River rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River. 199282 Holliday Creek Highway 16 MOTI 305946 5896010 11 – 3.3 High A large glaciated system with a cobble-boulder substrate and an intact mixed riparian zone, primarily deciduous. Occasional large woody debris features created deep pool habitats and likely gravel tailouts. The system had a lower gradient, with occasional pockets of gravels suitable for spawning salmonids ranging from 20cm to 100cm in size. 199278 Teepee Creek Highway 5 MOTI 344031 5862744 11 SA 0.0 High The stream was surveyed from the highway to the railway and was a mid-sized, steeper cobble-boulder step-pool system with only rare pockets of unembedded gravels. Deep pools were present, formed by boulder and large woody debris scour. A salmon point was noted near the pipeline location in FISS. Numerous small steps ranging from 30–60cm were present due to the steep, boulder-dominated nature of the stream. – Teepee Creek Railway CN Rail 344222 5862742 11 – – Medium – fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary(dat = pscis_phase2) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Summary of Phase 2 fish passage reassessments.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.5: Summary of Phase 2 fish passage reassessments.

Crossing 199171 is located 50m upstream of Fraser Lake, on Gala Bay Road, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1790951). Approximately 275m upstream, PSCIS crossing 7622 is located on Stella Road and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1794196). Both crossings are within the Francois Lake watershed group. Background At this location, Burnt Cabin Creek is a third order stream and drains a watershed of approximately 4.5km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1237m to 683m near the crossing (Table 3.9). In 2004, crossing 7622 was assessed with fish passage assessment by REGIONAL MANAGER NORTHERN, MoE [FIND_REPORT]. In 2023, crossing 199171 was assessed with fish passage assessment [ADD_FRASER_REPORT], and both sites were prioritized for follow-up with habitat confirmation assessments due to the presence of high-value habitat observed upstream during the 2023 assessment [ADD_FRASER_REPORT]. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.9: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 199171.

The stream was highly channelized due to residential properties on both sides. The habitat was rated as medium with minimal cover and few pools suitable for fish, but gravels were present for spawning. Anecdotal information from a neighboring landowner suggested the stream below Gala Bay Road had been diverted to accommodate a driveway for a recreational property. The average channel width was 2.4m, the average wetted width was 1.4m, and the average gradient was 1.3%.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks.. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199171 and Downstream of Crossing 7622 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199171 for 275m , all the way to crossing 7622 on Stella Road (Figure 3.3). The habitat was rated as medium value, with good flow and abundant gravels, flowing through several private properties with newly established quad and foot traffic trails. Pools were limited and predominantly shallow. The average channel width was 2.4m, the average wetted width was 1.2m, and the average gradient was 4.5%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 7622 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 7622 for 500m (Figure 3.4). The habitat was rated as high value with relatively steep gradients and abundant functional large woody debris creating steps and pools 20–30mm deep. In some sections, the stream widened and became shallow, with abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Overhead cover was extensive. Near the upper end of the site, the forest had been cleared for pipeline use, resulting in significant bank erosion and ripirian removal (Figure 3.5).. A large pipe crossed the stream near the pipeline corridor. The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.The average channel width was 3.5m, the average wetted width was 1.4m, and the average gradient was 7%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Gala Bay Road crossing (199171) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. This culvert had a 0.9m outlet drop, very likely inhibiting fish passage. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 1,500,000. Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Stella Road crossing (7622) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended.

Crossing 199328 is located 230m upstream of Fraser Lake, on Gala Bay Road, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1790947 and 3365573). Approximately 270m upstream, PSCIS crossing 199172 is located on Stella Road and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1794199). Both crossings are within the Francois Lake watershed group. Background At this location, Scotch Creek is a third order stream and drains a watershed of approximately 9.1km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1091m to 680m near the crossing (Table 3.14). In 2023, crossings 199328 and 199172 were assessed with fish passage assessments [ADD_FRASER_REPORT].

Stream Characteristics at Crossings 199328 and 199172 At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing 199328 on Gala Bay Road was embedded, 100% backwatered, and ranked as passable to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 3.16). PSCIS crossing 199172 on Stella Road was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 3.17). This culvert had a significant 1.35m outlet drop, likely inhibiting fish passage. In 2024, a third crossing (PSCIS 203297) was assessed on a private road, approximately ~140m upstream Stella Road. Two pipes, 0.6m and 0.45m in diameter, were present and the larger culvert had a significant 0.7m outlet drop. The inlet side of the road had completely eroded into the stream, obstructing the view of the inlet. The heavily overgrown and collapsing road appeared to be private access and would be a good candidate for removal. LINK TO APPENDIX 1.

The habitat was rated as medium value. The stream had been channelized with riprap at the upstream end of the survey and near the downstream lake. On the lakeside, the left bank was a mix of forest and recreational property lawns. A historic Chinook point was recorded near the culvert at Gala Bay Road. Some type of bloom was observed along the lake shoreline (Figure 3.7).. The average channel width was 2.9m, the average wetted width was 1.6m, and the average gradient was 1.8%.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as .. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199328 and Downstream of Crossing 199172 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199328 on Gala Bay Road upstream to crossing 199172 on Stella Road, a distance of approximately 270m (Figure ??). The habitat was rated as medium value with limited pools, however abundant overhanging vegetation and small woody debris provided cover and gravels suitable for resident salmonid spawning were present. The average channel width was 2.1m, the average wetted width was 1.3m, and the average gradient was 3%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant. Incision was evident, beginning with a deep cut at the culvert outlet under Stella Road and continuing downstream to Gala Bay Road. The riparian area was generally intact throughout most of the stream, except for the downstream 75m, where private land development on the north side had resulted in a lawn and riparian vegetation removal up to the channel edge. A historic Chinook point near Gala Bay Road may have resulted from a past salvage operation. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199172 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199172 for 550m (Figure 3.8). The habitat was rated as medium value with abundant functional large woody debris creating occasional pools 20–30mm deep, suitable for overwintering juvenile fish. Overhead cover was extensive, and occasional gravels were suitable for spawning. Approximately 400m upstream of Stella Road, the stream transitioned to a beaver-impounded area with four consecutive 1–1.5m high dams holding back a large volume of water, but flow over or under allowed possible fish passage. The impounded area extended as far as the surveyed area. The average channel width was 2.6m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 4.3%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant. A fish (~40mm) was observed after the second beaver dam. PSCIS crossing 203297 was located 150m upstream of Stella Road on private property, where the culvert had a significant outlet drop and severe erosion, creating a fish passage barrier. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate A the time of reporting in 2025, crossing 199328 on Gala Bay Road was ranked as passable to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol and no remediation is required (MoE 2011). Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Stella Road crossing (199172) with a bridge (18 m span) is recommended. This culvert had a 1.35m outlet drop, very likely inhibiting fish passage. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 3,600,000.

Crossing 199173 is located 115m upstream of the Nechako River, on Dog Creek Road, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1794340). Approximately 2km upstream, PSCIS crossing 199174 is located on Sutherland FSR and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Forests. The last 200m of the stream was incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, as it flowed more directly southeast to join the Nechako River rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River.

The stream provided excellent habitat, with several pools and abundant undercut banks. Fish were observed during the assessment (~40‚Äì90mm in length). Upstream of the crossing, the stream was channelized with some pockets of gravel suitable for rearing rainbow trout and potentially Chinook. It then transitioned into beaver-impounded wetland areas storing large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow at this crossing. There was extensive cattle trampling around the inlet of the pipe and throughout the surveyed upstream area. The crossing was located approximately 150m upstream from the Nechako River mainstem.

Comments: At the time of assessment, the stream was dry at the crossing; however, it contained medium-value habitat. Upstream of the culvert, the stream was primarily dry for the first 300m, then intermittent pools began to appear, associated with beaver activity. Approximately 450‚Äì500m upstream, the stream became nearly fully watered, with pools up to 40cm deep. Downstream of the crossing was dominated by beaver-impounded wetland areas, which were storing large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow at the downstream crossing on Dog Creek Road. Further downstream, approximately 300m upstream of the crossing on Dog Creek Road, the stream transitioned to a channelized system with some pockets of gravel suitable for rearing rainbow trout and potentially Chinook. However, heavy cattle impacts were observed at both this crossing and the downstream crossing on Dog Creek Road. ##this is useful to get some comments for the report hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site &amp; location == &#39;ds&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site &amp; location == &#39;us&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site2 &amp; location == &#39;ds&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) hab_site |&gt;filter(site == my_site2 &amp; location == &#39;us&#39;) |&gt;pull(comments) Stream Characteristics Downstream of Crossing 199173 The stream was surveyed downstream from crossing 199173 for 115m (Figure 3.9)..

The average channel width was 3.5m, the average wetted width was 1.3m, and the average gradient was 6%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with fines sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and boulders.. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199173 and Downstream of Crossing 199174 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199173 for 575m (Figure 3.10). The habitat was rated as medium with some pockets of gravels present suitable for rainbow trout and potentially Chinook rearing. Fish were observed throughout the area surveyed. Heavy cattle impacts were observed throughout the surveyed area, with the most pronounced damage in low-gradient sections with easily accessible banks. The stream changed character at a beaver dam located approximately 300–350m upstream, transitioning from a channelized stream to beaver-impounded wetland areas. A fence intended to restrict cattle access had been breached. A series of beaver dams began approximately 300m upstream of the road, with over three dams observed, some up to 1.5m high. The dams were mature, well-developed, and had vegetation growing through them. The beaver dams were impounding large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow downstream at the Dog Creek Road crossing. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 3m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 2.4%. The stream was surveyed downstream from crossing 199174 for 300m (Figure 3.11). The stream was intermittent for the first ~70m before transitioning into a beaver-impacted wetland area. Approximately 250m downstream of Sutherland Road, several large consecutive mature beaver dams were present and appeared to continue as far as the area surveyed. Signs of cattle trampling were observed throughout the stream, and the channel frequently split into several smaller channels. The habitat was rated as medium, with few gravels for spawning but abundant pools created by beaver dams. Total cover amount was rated as abundant with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 2m, the average wetted width was 1m, and the average gradient was 1.2%.The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant.. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199174 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199174 for 650m (Figure 3.12). The habitat was rated as medium value and had been heavily impacted by cattle throughout the surveyed area, with evidence of bank trampling and extensive low-gradient muddy sections. Upstream of the culvert, the stream was primarily dry for the first 300m, with young forest and shrubs. At this point, intermittent pools began to appear, associated with beaver activity. At approximately 450–500m upstream, the stream became almost entirely watered, with pools up to 40cm deep. Many surveyed areas resembled wetland habitat, with spirea, willow, alder, and trembling aspen throughout. The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 2.5m, the average wetted width was 0.9m, and the average gradient was 1.2%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and overhanging vegetation. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Dog Creek Road crossing (199173) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 1,500,000. At the time of assessment, the upstream crossing on Sutherland FSR was unlikely a barrier to fish passage, and restoration efforts should prioritize the upstream crossing on Dog Creek Road. However, should restoration activities proceed at crossing 199174, replacement with a bridge spanning 15 m is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the estimated cost for the replacement is $ 450,000.

Comments: Large multi-plate oval culvert with a substantial 50m-wide outlet pool. The stream had high flow at the time of assessment. Culvert slope and outlet pool depth were estimated as the pool was too deep to wade. Deep pools over 1m, formed by functional large woody debris, provided good overwintering habitat for fish of all ages. Gravels suitable for spawning were present. Downstream of the culvert, the stream ran parallel to the highway with banks reinforced by riprap and large wood secured with metal wiring to create habitat and reduce flow.

Comments: The culvert had a significant 1.4m outlet drop, and inlet drop due to a small debris jam. The stream flowed through mature old-growth forest and provided high-quality habitat with steep gradients, step pools, and cascade pools, suggesting the potential presence of bull trout. The highway crossing had a large amount of road fill, making construction difficult and expensive. The site would be a good candidate for replacement if feasible. The riparian area at the outlet had been cleared due to overhead powerlines.

Comments: A moderate outlet drop was present and would be substantial at lower flows. Flow was steady at the time of assessment. The culvert was in good condition. A large, deep outlet pool indicated the culvert was likely undersized for the stream. Additionally, minimal road fill made this crossing a significant flood hazard, which could wash out Highway 5. Downstream, the stream had frequent pools 0.3‚Äì0.5m deep, providing good overwintering habitat for fish, and abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Roughly 150m downstream of the culvert, several cattle pens crossed the stream and appeared to be set up to provide cattle access for drinking. These areas were visibly trampled, with significant loss of riparian vegetation. Upstream, the stream was relatively confined, with only rare pockets of unembedded gravels. Deep pools were present, formed by boulder and large woody debris scour. A salmon point was noted near the pipeline location in FISS. Numerous small steps, ranging from 30‚Äì60cm, were present due to the steep, boulder-dominated nature of the stream. Electrofishing would be beneficial for further assessment. The site was a highway crossing, making replacement difficult. A small ford was located approximately 5m downstream of the culvert outlet.

The crossing is located 2.4km upstream of the Fraser River, on Highway 16, which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 29925). The crossing is within the Upper Fraser River watershed group. Background At this location, Holliday Creek is a fourth order stream and drains a high elevation watershed of approximately 55.2km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 2553m to 777m near the crossing (Table 3.61). In 2023, crossing 199282 was assessed with fish passage assessments and was prioritized for follow-up with habitat confirmation assessments due to the presence of high-value habitat observed upstream [ADD_FRASER_REPORT]. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.61: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 199282.

Comments: A significant outlet drop was present. Flow was high at the time of assessment, and at lower flows, the outlet drop would be even more substantial. Although the culvert was large, it was still likely undersized for the stream. The stream was a large glaciated system with a cobble-boulder substrate and an intact mixed riparian zone, primarily deciduous. Occasional large woody debris features created deep pool habitats and pockets of gravels were present suitable for spawning salmonids. A fish (~60mm) was observed during habitat confirmation.
