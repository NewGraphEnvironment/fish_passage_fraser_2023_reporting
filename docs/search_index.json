"],["executive-summary.html", "Executive Summary", " Executive Summary Since 2023, the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc), with funding from the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, has been actively involved in planning, coordinating, and conducting fish passage restoration efforts within the Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, Morkhill River, Upper Fraser River, and François Lake watershed groups which are sub-basins of the Upper Fraser River watershed. The primary objective of this project is to identify and prioritize fish passage barriers within these study areas, develop comprehensive restoration plans to address these barriers, and foster momentum for broader ecosystem restoration initiatives. While the primary focus is on fish passage, this work also serves as a lens through which to view the broader ecosystems, leveraging efforts to build capacity for ecosystem restoration and improving our understanding of watershed health. We recognize that the health of life - such as our own - and the health of our surroundings are interconnected, with our overall well-being dependent on the health of our environment. Fish passage assessment procedures conducted through SERNbc in the Upper Fraser River Watershed since 2023 are amalgamated in Tables 4.1 - 4.2 which includes links to project reporting for each site. A summary of activities included in this report is provided below: Field assessments were conducted from September 09, 2023-October 09, 2024, by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio., Mateo Winterscheidt, B.Sc, and Lucy Schick, B.Sc. A total of 186 Fish Passage Assessments were completed across the 2023 and 2024 field seasons, including 184 Phase 1 assessments and 2 reassessments. During the 2024 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 13 sites within the Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, Morkhill River, Upper Fraser River, and François Lake watershed groups. A total of approximately 14 km of stream was assessed. A major challenge in advancing fish passage restoration is the complexity of working across jurisdictions and with multiple stakeholders—rail and highway authorities, forestry ministries, licensees, and private landowners. These partners are often being asked to accommodate priorities that originate outside their mandates and budgets. Convincing them to invest in difficult, high-cost interventions—like modifying crossings or relocating infrastructure—requires navigating uncertainty about costs and ecological outcomes, as well as a disconnect between the benefits to watershed health and the internal pressures or performance goals of these agencies. It’s a tough ask: to take on massive, uncertain projects when they’re already stretched thin with their own responsibilities. Fish passage restoration within the Upper Fraser River watershed and across British Columbia is further complicated by the legacy of infrastructure deeply embedded in the landscape. Roads, railways, highways, community infrastructure and private assets often constrain floodplains and disrupt natural hydrological processes. While targeted repairs to individual barriers are essential, they won’t resolve the broader systemic issues without rethinking and restructuring how infrastructure interacts with watershed function. Loss of riparian vegetation and intensive beaver management only add to the degradation. Addressing these challenges means making strategic, well-communicated choices—picking battles carefully, building trust, and staying committed to a longer-term transformation. All field activities from 2023 and 2024—including fish passage assessments, habitat confirmation assessments, and drone imagery collection—were consolidated into a centralized interactive table. This tool enables multi-criteria querying (e.g., by watershed group, stream name, road name, PSCIS ID, or top-ranked sites) with direct links to supporting documentation. While preliminary top remediation priorities are provided by watershed group, these rankings are inherently subjective and can depend on the capacity and willingness of infrastructure owners and tenure holders to support implementation—both financially and over the often multi-year project timelines. In practice, we must often act opportunistically, pursuing simpler, lower-cost options to maintain momentum and achieve near-term progress. Government, community groups, landowners, non-profits, industry and other stakeholders should work collaboratively to address high and moderate priority barriers identified in Table 4.2. Although the table presents many options, linked reports specify whether each site is a low, moderate, or high priority. Progress on any front is meaningful, and aiming to remediate at least one high-priority site per year per watershed group—regardless of its overall rank—is a practical and effective approach. Of key importance as well - the placement and design of infrastructure often drives floodplain disconnection and watershed degradation. Thus, sustainable restoration must extend beyond culvert upgrades toward reimagining how infrastructure interacts with the landscape—supporting reconnection of floodplains, wetland restoration, and coexistence with keystone species such as beaver, which create wetlands and slow flows, and salmon, which deliver marine nutrients and cultural richness to upstream ecosystems. Foundation species like cottonwood and old-growth conifers further support watershed health by stabilizing banks, shading streams, and contributing organic material, and their restoration and conservation must be integrated alongside fish passage reconnection in any comprehensive watershed planning effort. Although subject to revisions and updates, this report provides a snapshot of the current state of fish passage restoration within study area watershed groups in the Upper Fraser River watershed. It is intended to inform and engage stakeholders, including indigenous communities, government agencies, and the public, in the ongoing work of restoring fish passage and improving watershed health. We hope that this report will inspire further collaboration and action to address the challenges of fish passage restoration in the context of overall watershed health. Recommendations for collaborative enhancement of fish passage restoration in the Upper Fraser River Region include: Maintain strong partnerships to support funding, site selection, remediation, and monitoring through adaptive management informed by traditional knowledge and real-time data. Coordinate with the Ministry of Transportation to pursue funding for engineering designs at the following crossings: PSCIS crossing 199171 on Burnt Cabin Creek along Gala Bay Road, in the Francois Lake watershed group. PSCIS crossing 199173 on a tributary to the Nechako River, on Dog Creek Road, in the Nechako River watershed group Use climate modeling to prioritize crossings that enable access to cold, drought-resistant habitats. Integrate fish passage restoration planning with other restoration and enhancement initiatives in the region to maximize benefits to fish populations as well as for communities within the Upper Fraser River watershed. This includes working with the Rivershed Society of BC, Nechako Environment and Watershed Stewardship Society (NEWSS), University of Northern British Columbia, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Ministry of Transportation, provincial regulators, and others to leverage funding, knowledge, and resources for fish passage restoration towards other projects related to watershed health in the region. Examples of where this is already taking in place in other watersheds includes: Leveraging of Morice River watershed group fish passage sites into the Bii Wenii Kwa Restoration/Recovery Plan (Irvine and Schick 2025b). Incorporation of Upper Bulkley River sites into the Neexdzii Kwah Restoration Planning (Irvine and Schick 2025b); Irvine and Schick (2025a)]. Develop strategies to explore cost and fisheries production benefits of stream crossing structure upgrades alongside alternative/additional restoration and enhancement investments such as land conservation/procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, water treatment and research. Ideentify and pursue opportunities to collaborate and leverage initiatives together in study area watersheds (ex. fish passage rehabilitation, riparian restoration and cattle exclusion) for maximum likely restoration benefits.

The primary objective of this project is to identify and prioritize fish passage barriers within these study areas, develop comprehensive restoration plans to address these barriers, and foster momentum for broader ecosystem restoration initiatives. While the primary focus is on fish passage, this work also serves as a lens through which to view the broader ecosystems, leveraging efforts to build capacity for ecosystem restoration and improving our understanding of watershed health. We recognize that the health of life - such as our own - and the health of our surroundings are interconnected, with our overall well-being dependent on the health of our environment. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.

Their Athabaskan language, Dakelh, has declined due to colonial policies, but revitalization efforts are ongoing. Organizations like the [Yinka Dene Language Institute](https://www.ydli.org/) work to document and promote Dakelh through education, literacy programs, and linguistic research [@yinkadenelanguageinstitute2025]. The Lheidli T&#39;enneh First Nation and local school districts have also developed language programs to preserve and teach Dakelh (@Ourlanguage2025). # # &lt;br&gt; # # The Dakelh people traditionally organize their lands into Keyohs, family-run territories passed down through generations. Each Keyoh is overseen by a Keyohwhudachun (Keyoh Holder), who manages land use and stewardship [@Keyohhuwunline2025]. Despite historical disruptions, Keyohs remain central to Dakelh identity and land management practices. # # # ### Lheidli T’enneh # # The Lheidli T&#39;enneh First Nations are a Dakelh sub-group whose traditional territory encompasses the Nechakoh (Nechako) River, Lhtakoh (Fraser) River, and Morkill River, and spans from west of Lheidli (Prince George) to Valemount. &quot;Lheidli&quot; translates to &quot;The People from the Confluence of the River,&quot; referring to the meeting of the Nechako (&quot;Nee Incha Koh&quot; – &quot;river with strong undercurrents&quot;) and Fraser (&quot;Ltha Koh&quot; – &quot;Big Mouth River&quot;) rivers in what is now Prince George, British Columbia [@Ourstory2025]. # # &lt;br&gt; # # Located within the traditional territory of the Lheidli T’enneh is Chun T’oh Whudujut (Ancient Forest), a Provincial Park and Protected Area 120km east of Prince George. The park has thousand-year-old western red cedars and a rich biodiversity of plants, mosses, lichens and fungi which can be explored through the trail network. Historically, Lheidli people would visit the stands from summer fishing camps along the upper Fraser River as well as gather medicinal plants, some of which were thought to be extinct. However, the park was not always a protected area and was initially slated for logging until a UNBC graduate student studying lichen biodiversity identified the ancient stands of western red cedars. Recognizing their ecological and cultural significance, trails were developed to highlight the cedars and advocate for their protection. Through partnerships with local hiking groups, UNBC, Lheidli T’enneh, and the Provincial Government, the Ancient Forest biodiversity assessment project has contributed to conservation efforts and tourism-based economic development in the Prince George area [@Chuntohwhudujutancientforest2025]. # # &lt;br&gt; # # ### Carrier Sekani # # The Carrier Sekani Tribal Council unifies six nations west of Lheidli (Prince George) whose traditional territories include the Lhtakoh (Fraser), Nechakoh (Nechako), Tsalakoh (Chilako), Endako, and Nadleh (Nautley) Rivers [@CSTCCSFNs].

As the largest salmon-producing river on Canada’s west coast (Bradford and Taylor 2023; “Dakleh Placenames” n.d.), it plays a crucial economic role in supporting forestry, agriculture, and hydroelectric power generation. Additionally, the Fraser River is vital for fisheries, especially for salmon populations, which are essential to both the local ecosystem and indigenous communities. The Upper Fraser River is commonly defined as the section of the mainstem north of Quesnel, flowing through the Cariboo and Fraser Plateau regions. Major tributaries include the Nechako, Quesnel, and McGregor rivers (D. P. Shaw and Tuominen, n.d.). This vast expanse supports many indigenous groups who utilize the land for cultural, spiritual, and economic practices. The Upper Fraser River, an 8th order stream, drains an area of 232,134km2 upstream of the McGregor River confluence. The seasonal hydrograph has a single broad peak in early summer due to snow and glacial melt from surrounding mountain ranges (Figure 2.2). The mean annual discharge at station 08KA005 in McBride, located roughly 200km southeast of Prince George, is 200.4m3/s # get date range for figure caption # flow_raw &lt;- tidyhydat::hy_daily_flows(&quot;08KA005&quot;) # print(start_year &lt;- flow_raw$Date %&gt;% min() %&gt;% lubridate::year()) # print(end_year &lt;- flow_raw$Date %&gt;% max() %&gt;% lubridate::year()) plot1 &lt;- fasstr::plot_longterm_monthly_stats( station_number = &quot;08KA005&quot;, ignore_missing = TRUE, add_year = 2023 ) print(plot1$`Long-term_Monthly_Statistics`) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for the Fraser River At McBride (Station #08KA005 - Lat 53.30172 Lon -120.14092).

Beginning at the Nechako Plateau, it flows north toward Fort Fraser, then east to its confluence with the Fraser River in Prince George. The Nechako River has three main tributaries: the Stuart River, the Endako River, and the Chilako River. It has a mean annual discharge of 278.5m3/s at station 08JC002, located near Isle Pierre, approximately 25km downstream of the Stuart River confluence. Upstream at station 08JC001 in Vanderhoof, the mean annual discharge is 141.3m3/s. Flow at Isle Pierre is strongly influenced by inflows from the Stuart River, resulting in higher peak levels and average discharge (Figure 2.3). In contrast, the hydrograph at Vanderhoof shows lower peak levels and mean flows, with peaks occurring in June and August (Figure 2.4). The Nechako River, meaning “Blackwater people’s river”, is home to the Cheslatta Carrier Nation who are part of the Dakelh people. Traditionally, they lived off the land near Tsetl’adak Bunk’ut “Peak Rock Lake” (Cheslatta Lake), however, in 1952, the construction of the Kenney Dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (now Rio Tinto Alcan) and the subsequent flooding of the Nechako Reservoir forced the Cheslatta Carrier people to abandon their ancestral lands (“The History of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation” n.d.; “Dakleh Placenames” n.d.). This relocation was done with little notice or compensation, causing significant disruptions to their community, culture, and way of life. Despite these challenges, the Cheslatta Carrier Nation has worked to preserve their cultural heritage and advocate for their rights and land restoration. # get date range for figure caption # flow_raw &lt;- tidyhydat::hy_daily_flows(&quot;08JC002&quot;) # print(start_year &lt;- flow_raw$Date %&gt;% min() %&gt;% lubridate::year()) # print(end_year &lt;- flow_raw$Date %&gt;% max() %&gt;% lubridate::year()) plot1 &lt;- fasstr::plot_longterm_monthly_stats( station_number = &quot;08JC002&quot;, ignore_missing = TRUE, add_year = 2023 ) print(plot1$`Long-term_Monthly_Statistics`) Figure 2.3: Hydrograph for the Nechako River at Isle Pierre, below the confluence of the Stuart River (Station #08JC002).

Available mean daily discharge data from 1915 to 2023. 2.4 Endako River The Endako River is a 6th order stream that flows southeast from Burns Lake to Fraser Lake, draining an area of 5,970km2. One hydrometric station (08JB004) was located in Endako but was only active during 1951. The mean annual discharge for that year was 12.7m3/s, with the hydrograph peaking in May–June. 2.5 Tsalakoh The Chilako River, known as Tsalakoh by the Dakelh people, translates to “beaver paw river”. It is a 6th order stream that flows north from the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Nechako River, draining an area of 3,634km2. One hydrometric station (08JC005) is located approximately 10km upstream of the confluence with the Nechako River; however, it was only active from 1960 to 1974. During this period, the mean annual discharge was 13.3m3/s, with peak flows typically occurring in May–June (Figure 2.5). # get date range for figure caption # flow_raw &lt;- tidyhydat::hy_daily_flows(&quot;08JC005&quot;) # print(start_year &lt;- flow_raw$Date %&gt;% min() %&gt;% lubridate::year()) # print(end_year &lt;- flow_raw$Date %&gt;% max() %&gt;% lubridate::year()) plot1 &lt;- fasstr::plot_longterm_monthly_stats( station_number = &quot;08JC005&quot;, ignore_missing = TRUE, add_year = 2023 ) print(plot1$`Long-term_Monthly_Statistics`) Figure 2.5: Hydrograph for the Chilako River Near Prince George (Station #08JC005 - Lat 53.808891 Lon -122.988892). Available mean daily discharge data from 1960 to 1974. 2.6 Fisheries The Fraser River watershed is the largest salmon-producing river system in British Columbia and one of the most significant on the Pacific Coast. It provides critical habitat for anadromous salmonids, resident freshwater species, and other aquatic organisms. The river supports indigenous, commercial, and recreational fisheries, with Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) playing a key ecological and economic role. The 2019 Big Bar landslide created a significant barrier to salmon migration in the Fraser River, further stressing already vulnerable populations. Extensive mitigation efforts, including rock removal and the construction of a fishway, have helped improve passage, with an estimated 2.9 million salmon successfully navigating the site in 2022. The Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance (UFFCA) has played a key role in supporting emergency response and recovery planning, working with federal and provincial agencies to ensure First Nations’ interests and traditional knowledge are incorporated into long-term recovery strategies. This includes ongoing monitoring, habitat restoration, and collaborative management to mitigate future risks to Fraser salmon populations (“Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance,” n.d.). 2.6.1 Lhtakoh The Fraser River mainstem serves as the primary migration corridor for all anadromous fish species returning to spawn in its tributaries. Historically, the Fraser supported some of the largest sockeye and chinook salmon runs in North America. However, climate change, habitat degradation, and fisheries pressures have led to declining salmon populations in recent decades. Upper Fraser sockeye populations have been in decline for several decades, likely due to reduced flows and altered water temperatures, affecting migration and spawning success (Levy and Nicklin 2018). The Early Stuart and Late Stuart sockeye are now classified as “Endangered” by COSEWIC (COSEWIC 2017). Under the Wild Salmon Policy, several Upper Fraser sockeye conservation units have been classified as “red-zoned” (Levy and Nicklin 2018). In 2005, Nesbit, Thibeault, and Borgstrom (2005) outlined key fisheries areas in the upper Fraser River watershed as the McLennan River, Swift Creek, and the upper mainstem of the Fraser River near Valemount and Tête Jaune Cache. These systems are known to support chinook salmon, with documented spawning in both Swift Creek and the McLennan River. At the time of reporting by Nesbit, Thibeault, and Borgstrom (2005), two Wildlife Habitat Areas (WHA 3155 and WHA 6012) were designated in the Tête Jaune Cache area based on high fisheries values. WHA 3155 encompassed the confluence of the McLennan and Fraser Rivers and was recognized as the largest chinook spawning area in the upper Fraser system. WHA 6012 protected an adjacent side channel further downstream, which was identified as important juvenile rearing and refuge habitat during high flow events. Although both WHAs have since been removed, their prior designation underscores the ecological importance of the area. Swift Creek is the site of ongoing conservation hatchery efforts by the Spruce City Wildlife Association (SCWA), which has operated a volunteer-run hatchery since 1987. Following upgrades in 2020, it is now considered the most technologically advanced hatchery in the province. Focused on restoring upper Fraser River chinook, which are listed as “Endangered” by COSEWIC (COSEWIC 2019), SCWA releases thousands of chinook fry into Swift Creek each spring as part of broader recovery initiatives targeting key spawning systems in the region (Spruce City Wildlife Association 2023). Three sub-watersheds within the upper Fraser River basin are designated as Fisheries Sensitive Watersheds (FSWs) due to the presence of sensitive fish species, including chinook salmon and bull trout. The Goat River and Milk River watersheds have held FSW status since 2013 (FLNRORD 2004b), and the Walker Creek watershed has been designated since 2004 (FLNRORD 2004a). The importance of salmon in the upper Fraser is strongly reflected in Valemount’s community identity, education, and ecotourism initiatives. Public engagement with the salmon run is encouraged through accessible viewing areas at George Hicks Regional Park on Swift Creek, the Fraser River at Tête Jaune Cache, and along the McLennan River—locations that serve both as local gathering points and platforms for increasing awareness of salmon life cycles and watershed stewardship (Tourism Valemount n.d.). 2.6.2 Nechakoh The Nechako River, a tributary of the Fraser River, supports Chinook salmon populations and serves as a migration corridor for sockeye salmon that spawn in the Stuart and Nadina/Francois Basins. Since the construction of the Kenney Dam in the 1950s, flows in the Nechako River have been regulated by Rio Tinto Alcan for hydroelectric power generation at the Kemano Generating Station on the Pacific Coast. In response to concerns over impacts on Nechako Chinook and Upper Fraser sockeye, flow management practices have been implemented. Since 1987, the Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program (NFCP) has operated an annual monitoring program, focussed on Nechako Chinook and migratory sockeye salmon designed to monitor the effectiveness of conservation measures specified in the 1987 Settlement Agreement between Canada, British Columbia, and Alcan (Levy and Nicklin 2018). The Nechako River also supports a genetically distinct and endangered population of white sturgeon with low natural recruitment. To address this decline, the Nechako White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative (NWSRI) was established, implementing conservation measures such as the Nechako White Sturgeon Conservation Centre. The facility focuses on conservation aquaculture to maintain genetic diversity and support population recovery. Since 2006, the NWSRI has been releasing tagged juvenile sturgeon annually into the Nechako River to aid in species restoration (“Nechako White Sturgeon Recovery Initiative | Home” n.d.). Indigenous fisheries organizations, including individual First Nations, the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council, and the Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance (UFFCA), are actively involved in fisheries management in the Nechako watershed. These organizations work to support conservation while ensuring the sustainability of Indigenous fisheries, which have cultural and subsistence importance (“Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance,” n.d.). 2.6.3 François Lake François Lake is one of the largest natural lakes in BC and supports landlocked Kokanee (O. nerka), as well as migratory sockeye salmon that access the lake via the Stellako River. François Lake is a key rearing area for juvenile salmon before migrating to the Fraser River. 2.6.4 Morkill River The Morkill River, a tributary to the upper Fraser, supports populations of bull trout, mountain whitefish, and rainbow trout. While salmon presence in the system is limited, the Morkill provides cold water inputs to the Fraser River, which may offer thermal refuge for migrating salmonids during warm summer months. 2.6.5 Salmon Stock Assessment Data Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data was accessed via the NuSEDS-New Salmon Escapement Database System through the Open Government Portal with results presented in Table 2.1 (Canada n.d.).

A review of available fisheries data, for the Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, François Lake, Morkill River and Upper Fraser River watershed groups, stratified by different habitat characteristics can provide insight into which habitats may provide the highest intrinsic value for fish species based on the number of fish captured in those habitats in past assessment work (Figures 2.6 - 2.7 - 2.8). It should be noted however that it should not be assumed that all habitat types have been sampled in a non-biased fashion or that particular sites selected do not have a disproportionate influence on the overall dataset composition (ie. fish salvage sites are often located adjacent to construction sites which are more commonly located near lower gradient stream reaches). fiss_species_table &lt;- readr::read_csv(&#39;data/inputs_extracted/fiss_species_table.csv&#39;) fiss_species_table %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the Upper Fraser River, Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, and François Lake watershed groups.&#39;, footnote_text = &#39;COSEWIC abbreviations : SC - Special concern DD - Data deficient NAR - Not at risk E - Endangered T - Threatened BC List definitions : Yellow - Species that is apparently secure Blue - Species that is of special concern Exotic - Species that have been moved beyond their natural range as a result of human activity &#39;, scroll = gitbook_on) Table 2.2: Fish species recorded in the Upper Fraser River, Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, and François Lake watershed groups.

"],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Collaborative GIS Environment 3.2 Planning 3.3 Fish Passage Assessments 3.4 Habitat Confirmation Assessments", " 3 Methods fish_col_permit_num &lt;- 3.1 Collaborative GIS Environment Geographical Information Systems are essential for developing and communicating restoration plans as well as the reasons they are required and how they are developed. Without the ability to visualize the landscape and the data that is used to make decisions, it is difficult to conduct and communicate the need for restoration, the details of past and future plans as well as and the potential results of physical works. To facilitate the planning and implementation of restoration activities, a collaborative GIS environment has been established using QGIS and is served on the cloud using source code stored here. This environment is intended to be a space where project team members can access, view, and contribute to the amalgamation of background spatial data and the development of restoration as well as monitoring for the project. The collaborative GIS environment allows users to view, edit, and analyze shared, up to date spatial data on personal computers in an office setting as well as on phones and tablets in the field. At the time of reporting, the environment was being used to develop and share maps, conduct spatial analyses, communicate restoration plans to stakeholders as well as to provide a central place to store methodologies and tools for conducting field assessments on standardized pre-developed digital forms. The platform can also be used to track the progress of restoration activities and monitor changes in the landscape over time, helping encourage the record keeping of past and future restoration activities in a coordinated manner. The shared QGIS project was created using scripts currently kept in dff-2022 with the precise calls to project creation scripts tracked in the project_creation_and_permissions.txt document kept in the main QGIS project directory. Information about the scripts used for GIS project creation and updates can be viewed here with outcomes of their use summarized below: Download and clip user specified layers from the BC Data Catalogue as well as data layers stored in custom Amazon Web Services buckets for an area of interest defined by a list of watershed groups and load to a geopackage called background_layers.gpkg stored in the main directory of the project. A project directory is created to hold the spatial data and QGIS project information (ie. layer symbology and naming conventions, metadata, etc.). Metadata for individual project spatial layers is kept in the rfp_tracking table within the background_layers.gpkg along with tables related to user supplied stream width/gradient inputs to bcfishpass to model potentially high value habitat that is accessible to fish species of interest. # this is good info but need to figure out where it appropriately sits # ### Issue Tracking # &quot;Issues&quot; logged on the online github platform are effective ways to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs related to project components. # They can be referenced with the scripts, text and actions used to address them by linking documentation to the issues with text comments # or programatically through `git` commit messages. Issues for this project are kept `r ngr::ngr_str_link_url(url_base = params$repo_url, url_resource = &quot;issues&quot;, anchor_text = &quot;here&quot;)`. 3.1.1 Mapping The workflows to produce the georeferenced pdf maps include using a QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required and are continuously evolving. At the time of reporting - mapping scripts and associated layer file were kept under version control within bcfishpass here. Loading the QGIS layer file within a QGIS project, allows load and representation of all map component layers provided the user points to a postgresql database populated via bcfishpass outputs. 3.2 Planning 3.2.1 Habitat Modelling Habitat modelling used to help guide planning for field assessments is generated by bcfishpass (Norris [2020] 2024) which has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation by generating a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity. We utilize the bcfishpass access model, linear spawning/rearing habitat model and lateral habitat connectivity for planning purposes. These models provide a valuable starting point, but their results are not definitive and should always be considered with professional judgment. Detailed information regarding model methodology, select parameters and known model limitations are detailed in Norris ([2020] 2024) with key documentation linked below: Access model Linear spawning/rearing habitat models Lateral habitat model Table 3.1 documents the custom species-specific thresholds for stream gradient and channel width applied to the linear spawning and rearing habitat model for this year’s project planning. Although parameter values were often modified to provide a more conservative estimate of habitat, the thresholds used in the model are loosely based on the references provided in Table 3.2. # &lt;br&gt; # # The access model identifies natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classify the accessibility of streams for fish [@norris2021smnorrisbcfishpass]. On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. # culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on # how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with # numerous parameters including known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, # the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, and an estimate of watershed area # (on 2nd order and higher streams). Furthermore, mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area, stream # discharge, and channel width can be collated using `bcfishpass`, `fwapg` and `bcfishobs`. This information can be used # to provide an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be # restored, by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. # # &lt;br&gt; # # The linear spawning and rearing habitat model uses species-specific thresholds for stream gradient (Table \\@ref(tab:tab-fish-spawning-rearing)), channel width or discharge, network connectivity, and habitat type to assess the intrinsic potential of streams to support spawning and rearing. It also incorporates documented spawning locations and literature-derived parameters to refine habitat suitability estimates. This model helps guide field assessments and prioritize locations for fish passage restoration. # # &lt;br&gt; # # &lt;!-- Project specific fish species at the end of this paragraph. --&gt; # Regarding gradients, `bcfishpass` calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this phase of the project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate &quot;potentially accessible habitat&quot; were based on estimated max gradients that rainbow trout (20%) and bull trout (25%) are likely to be capable of ascending. # # &lt;br&gt; # # Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value rearing, overwintering, and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream). # # &lt;br&gt; # # Following delineation of &quot;potentially accessible habitat&quot;, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 20% and 25% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories. Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. 3.2.1.1 Statistical Support for bcfishpass Fish Habitat Modelling Updates This project provided the statistical background for updates to bcfishpass that facilitated incorporation of channel width (observed or predicted) into species specific linear spawning/rearing habitat models. In early 2021, Bayesian statistical methods were developed to predict channel width in all provincial freshwater atlas stream segments where width measurements had not previously been measured in the field. The model was based on the relationship between watershed area and mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area (Thorley and Irvine 2021). In December of 2021, Thorley and Irvine (2021) methods were updated using a power model derived by Finnegan et al. (2005) which relates stream discharge to watershed area and mean annual precipitation resulting in Thorley, Norris, and Irvine (2021) which was utilized for channel width estimates within bcfishpass modelling at the time of reporting. More detailed documentation of the methodology used to facilitate both the data collection and statistical analysis can be sourced in Irvine ([2021] 2022) and Thorley, Norris, and Irvine (2021). In 2024, in collaboration with Poisson Consulting - stream discharge and temperature causal effects pathways were mapped with the intent of focusing aquatic restoration actions in areas of highest potential for positive impacts on fisheries values (ie. elimination of areas from intrinic models where water temperatures are likely too cold to support fish production). The project began with a custom mechanistic model (visually represented here), but the model struggled to converge. The project then shifted to the air2stream model, which offers a middle ground between fully mechanistic models—often data-intensive and reliant on quantities that are difficult to measure or estimate—and purely statistical models, which lack physical justification and perform poorly when extrapolated to new conditions (Toffolon and Piccolroaz (2015)). After several adaptations, the expected stream temperatures were best modeled using the four-parameter version of the air2stream model, with added random effects by site for each of the four parameters (Hill, Thorley, and Irvine (2024)). The data used for the model were sourced from the following locations, for years 2019-2021: Water temperature data collected in the Nechako Watershed were downloaded from Zenodo (Gilbert et al. 2022).

This informs whether upstream culvert upgrades would restore access for anadromous species (e.g., salmon) or primarily benefit resident fish already upstream. We document these features by measuring height, gradient, and pool depth, recording field observations, capturing site photographs, and reviewing background sources for context. 3.3.2 Road Stream Crossings In the field, crossings prioritized for follow-up were first assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in “Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures” (MoE 2011). The reader is referred to (MoE 2011) for detailed methodology. Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, road fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.3). fpr_table_habvalue |&gt; knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T, label = NA) |&gt; kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) |&gt; kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.3: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Tables 3.4 - 3.5). These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data, a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(V4 = names(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) |&gt; dplyr::select(V4, everything()) |&gt; janitor::row_to_names(1) |&gt; ##turn the table sideways dplyr::mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.4: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier The habitat gain index is the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 25% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of anadromous species (bull trout) are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For reporting of Phase 1 - fish passage assessments within the body of this report (Table 3.4), a “total” value of habitat &lt;20% output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 25% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, bull trout rearing maximum gradient threshold (10.5%) was used. To generate estimates for area of habitat upstream (m2), the estimated linear length was multiplied by half the downstream channel width measured (overall triangular channel shape) as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they allow a rough idea of the best candidates for follow up. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from MoE (2011) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. Based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts, for this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type . Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. 3.3.3 Cost Estimates Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to help refine estimates which have since been adjusted for inflation in 2020 and based on past experience. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $30000/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 15m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $100k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page then adjusted for inflation in 2020). For larger streams (&gt;6m), estimated span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream. For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 15 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table 3.6) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. sfpr_xref_road_cost() |&gt; dplyr::mutate(cost_m_1000s_bridge = formatC(cost_m_1000s_bridge * 15000, format=&quot;d&quot;, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(cost_embed_cv = formatC(cost_embed_cv * 1000, format=&quot;d&quot;, big.mark=&quot;,&quot;)) |&gt; dplyr::rename( Class = my_road_class, Surface = my_road_surface, `Class Multiplier` = road_class_mult, `Surface Multiplier` = road_surface_mult, `Bridge $/15m` = cost_m_1000s_bridge, `Streambed Simulation $` = cost_embed_cv ) |&gt; dplyr::filter(!is.na(Class)) |&gt; dplyr::mutate(Class = dplyr::case_when( Class == &#39;fsr&#39; ~ stringr::str_to_upper(Class), TRUE ~ stringr::str_to_title(Class)), Surface = stringr::str_to_title(Surface) ) |&gt; # filter(Class != &#39;FSR&#39; &amp; Surface != &#39;Paved&#39;) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.6: Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.

Within the “condition” risk category - data was collected and crossings were ranked based on erosion, embankment and blockage issues. The “climate” risk category included ranked assessments of the likelihood of both a flood event affecting the culvert as well as the consequence of a flood event affecting the culvert. Within the “priority” category the following factors were ranked - traffic volume, community access, cost, constructability, fish bearing status and environmental impacts (Table 3.7).

The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.3). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collected on digital field forms adapted from provincial “Site Cards”. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to a minimum distance 300m and upstream to a minimum distance of 500 - 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. # Need to move text with code to code block then comment out. Apparently even if you comment out text with code in an rmd file the code still runs. # ## Fish Sampling # # ### Electrofishing # Fish sampling was conducted on a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. Electrofishing was utilized for fish sampling according to stream inventory standards and procedures found in the Reconnaissance (1:20 000) Fish and Fish Habitat Inventory Manual [@resourcesinventorycommittee2001Reconnaissance20a]. A Haltech 2000 backpack electrofisher was used within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings and seconds, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start and end locations, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. # # # &lt;!-- We did not use minnow trapping in 2024 and unsure if we will in the future so leaving this commented out for now. Another section to add in the future will be eDNA sampling. --&gt; # &lt;!-- ### Minnowtrapping --&gt; # # &lt;!-- In the case where electrofishing was not a sufficient method of fish sampling, such as deep areas, streams with insufficient conductance, or temperatures below 5 degrees, minnowtraps were used. --&gt; # # # ### Fish Handling and Processing # Captured fish were held in buckets with sufficient water to minimize stress until processing, and multiple buckets were used when catch numbers were high. For each fish captured, fork length, weight and species was recorded with results documented in the fish data submission spreadsheet. # # ### Pit Tagging # # Fish with a fork length greater than 60 mm and belonging to species approved under the scientific fish collection permit `r fish_col_permit_num` were tagged with Passive Integrated Transponders (PIT tags) using the [Abdominal Cavity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CKZ9yaS5o8) method outlined by Biomark. To anesthetize fish prior to pit tagging, we used a solution of approximately 0.1 mL of clove oil per 1 L of water (1:10,000). This concentration was selected for its efficiency in providing effective sedation with minimal residual effects, making it ideal for studies in which fish are released back into their natural habitats [@fernandes_etal2017efficacyclove]. The clove oil solution was prepared in advance by dissolving pure clove oil in ethyl alcohol in a 1:9 ratio (clove oil: ethyl alcohol) to enhance solubility, then mixed into the water bucket [@fernandes_etal2017efficacyclove]. Fish were immersed in this solution until they reached an appropriate level of anesthesia for handling and then were tagged. To maintain needle sharpness and minimize injury risk, needles were replaced approximately every 10 fish. Each tagged fish was scanned with the PIT reader, and both the PIT tag ID and row ID were recorded. Once tagged, fish were placed into a bucket of fresh water and allowed to recover before being released back into the stream. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit `r fish_col_permit_num`. 3.4.1 Aerial Imagery Scripted processing and serving of UAV imagery collected during the project is available at https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/stac_uav_bc/ (Irvine [2025] 2025). OpenDroneMap was utilized to produce orthomosaics, digital surface models (DSMs), and digital terrain models (DTMs) (OpenDroneMap Authors [2014] 2025). To support efficient web-based access - imagery products were converted to cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) using rio-cogeo, then collated accordiong to the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification with pystac and uploaded to S3 storage Amazon Web Services (2025). A titiler tile server was set up to facilitate interactive viewing of the orthoimagery and an Application Program Interface (API) leveraging stac-fastapi-pgstac is served at https://images.a11s.one to enable linking of collection images through QGIS as well as remote spatial and temporal querying using open source software such as rstac (Development Seed [2019] 2025; stac-utils 2025; Simoes et al. 2021).

Records from the following datasets have been included: The Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS); the Fish Habitat Inventory and Information Program (FHIIP); the Field Data Information System (FDIS) and the Resource Analysis Branch (RAB) inventory studies. The main intent of this layer is to have a single layer of all known obstacles to fish passage. It is important to note that not all waterbodies have been studied and, not all lengths of many waterbodies have been studied so there are a very high number of obstacles in the real world that are not recorded in this dataset. This layer simply reports the obstacles to fish that are known. It is also very important to note that we are acknowledging these features as obstacles to fish passage versus barriers to fish passage. This is because an obstacle may be a barrier at one time of year but not at other times depending on the volume of water present and also, what is a barrier to one species of fish is not necessarily a barrier to another species. whse_fish.fiss_stream_sample_sites_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/e616864b-8991-42d1-a2f9-4d4402c32be8 This spatial layer displays stream inventory sample sites that have had full or partial surveys, and contains measurements or indicator information of the data collected at each survey site on each date. whse_fish.pscis_assessment_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/7ecfafa6-5e18-48cd-8d9b-eae5b5ea2881 Points where a fish passage assessment has been performed on a stream crossing structure.

Design points have been identified as a priority for remediation based on a variety of potential criteria: quality of habitat upstream, quantity of fish habitat upstream, number and importance of species present, operational plans for the road cost of the proposed remediation, etc. They are sites where the amount of habitat to be gained by remediation has been confirmed and where a design has actually been completed. whse_fish.pscis_habitat_confirmation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/572595ab-0a25-452a-a857-1b6bb9c30495 Points where an evaluation of the fish habitat up and downstream of a road crossing have been carried out. Phase 2 of 4 in the Fish Passage Workflow, Habitat Confirmations are done at sites where the crossing structure is known to be a failure. The Habitat Confirmation is performed to ensure that the site in question is a good candidate for moving on to the Design (Phase 3) and Remediation (Phase 4) stages of the workflow. The Habitat Confirmation confirms the crossing is a barrier, places the crossing in context with respect to other roads and crossings in the watershed and also quantifies and qualifies how much habitat will be gained if the site is fixed. whse_fish.pscis_remediation_svw https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/1596afbf-f427-4f26-9bca-d78bceddf485 Points where a barrier to fish passage has been rectified or remediated.

Burn severity mapping is conducted using best available pre- and post-fire satellite multispectral imagery acquired by the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite or the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor aboard the Landsat-8 and 9 satellites. The post-fire imagery is acquired during the subsequent growing season. Mapping conducted during the subsequent growing season benefits from greater post-fire image availability and is expected to be more representative of tree mortality. Every attempt is made to use cloud, smoke, shadow and snow-free imagery that was acquired prior to September 30th. Please note, this layer is 1-year-later burn severity dataset. The same-year burn severity mapping dataset (WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.VEG_BURN_SEVERITY_SAME_YR_SP) is considered an interim product to this layer. 4.2.0.1 Methodology: • Select suitable pre- and post-fire imagery or create a cloud/snow/smoke-free composite from multiple images scenes • Calculate normalized burn severity ratio (NBR) for pre- and post-fire images • Calculate difference NBR (dNBR) where dNBR = pre NBR – post NBR • Apply a scaling equation (dNBR_scaled = dNBR*1000 + 275)/5) • Apply BARC thresholds (76, 110, 187) to create a 4-class image (unburned, low severity, medium severity, and high severity) • Apply region-based filters to reduce noise • Confirm burn severity analysis results through visual quality control • Produce a vector dataset and apply E whse_imagery_and_base_maps.aimg_orthophoto_tiles_poly https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/60d873d3-2e91-4c56-8e30-e5cb2872d1f8 A set of polygons representing the geographic coverage of all individual orthophotos from the provincial collection that are available for sale to the public. whse_imagery_and_base_maps.mot_culverts_sp https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/89d44ba6-7236-48ed-afab-f25a98c846ef A Culvert is a pipe (less than 3m in diameter) or half-round flume used to transport or drain water under or away from the road and/or right of way.

In the event of a discrepancy in the data, the metes and bounds description will prevail. Although the boundaries were drawn based on the legal metes and bounds descriptions, they may differ from how regional districts and their member municipalities and electoral areas currently view and/or manage their boundaries. Where discrepancies are noted, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (the custodian) enters into discussion with the local governments whose boundaries are affected. In order to effect a change to the boundary, Cabinet approval is required. This is done through an Order in Council (OIC). While discrepancies to administrative boundaries are being resolved, boundaries may be adjusted on an ongoing basis until the requested changes are completed. The OIC_YEAR and OIC_NUMBER fields indicate the year that the boundary was passed under OIC and its associated number. The AFFECTED_ADMIN_AREA_ABRVN identifies the administrative areas that are affected by the OIC. See all of the administrative areas currently in the Administrative Boundaries Management System (ABMS). The complimentary point dataset that defines the administrative areas is also available.

Places of special ecological importance are designated as ecological reserves for scientific research and educational purposes. Source data is Tantalis. *April 18, 2018: Prior to this date this dataset had one spatial boundary per park per survey plan that intersected the boundary of that park. This resulted in multiple identical boundaries for each park that had more than one survey plan overlapping it’s boundaries. The change aggregated the park data so that there is just one boundary per park with the plan numbers concatenated into a single column where each different plan number is separated by a comma. whse_wildlife_management.wcp_fish_sensitive_ws_poly https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/1a560a12-9be1-49a4-971a-dbc80875a0d7 The dataset contains approved legal boundaries for fisheries sensitive watersheds. A FSW is a mapped area with specific management objectives intended to guide development activities which may adversely impact important fish values * Metadata information for bcfishpass and bcfishobs layers can be provided here in the future but currently can usually be sourced from https://smnorris.github.io/bcfishpass/06_data_dictionary.html . 4.3 Planning 4.3.1 Habitat Modelling Habitat modelling from bcfishpass including access model, linear spawning/rearing habitat model and lateral habitat connectivity models for watershed groups within our study area were updated for the spring of 2025 and are included spatially in the collaborative GIS project. A snapshot of these outputs related to each modeled and PSCIS stream crossing structure are also included within an sqlite database within this year’s project reporting/code repository here. 4.3.1.1 Statistical Support for bcfishpass Fish Habitat Modelling Updates Initial mapping of stream discharge and temperature causal effects pathways for the future purpose of focusing aquatic restoration actions in areas of highest potential for positive impacts on fisheries values (ie. elimination of areas from intrinsic models where water temperatures are likely too cold to support fish production) are detailed in Hill, Thorley, and Irvine (2024) which is included as Attachment - Water Temperature Modelling. 4.4 Fish Passage Assessments Field assessments were conducted from September 09, 2023- October 09, 2024, by Allan Irvine, R.P.Bio., Mateo Winterscheidt, B.Sc, and Lucy Schick, B.Sc. 4.4.1 Road Stream Crossings A total of 186 Fish Passage Assessments were completed, including 184 Phase 1 assessments and 2 reassessments. Of the 186 sites where fish passage assessments were completed, 184 were not yet inventoried in the PSCIS system. This included 20 crossings considered “passable”, 31 crossings considered “potential” barriers, and 128 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011). Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 5 crossings assessed were fords and were ranked as “unknown” according to the provincial protocol. Reassessments were completed at 2 sites where PSICS data required updating. A summary of crossings assessed, a rough cost estimate for remediation, and a priority ranking for follow-up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table 4.5. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. The “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed MoE (2011) and represent an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout under any flow conditions that may occur throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and O’Hanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; E. A. Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. tab_cost_est_phase1 |&gt; select(`PSCIS ID`:`Cost Est ( $K)`) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments ranked as a &#39;barrier&#39; or &#39;potential&#39; barrier. &quot;, sp_network_caption), scroll = gitbook_on) Table 4.5: Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments ranked as a ‘barrier’ or ‘potential’ barrier.

During the 2024 field assessments, habitat confirmation assessments were conducted at 13 sites within the Nechako River, Lower Chilako River, Upper Fraser River, Morkill River, and Francois Lake watershed groups. A total of approximately 14 km of stream was assessed. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. Results are summarized in Figure 4.1 and Table 4.6 with raw habitat data included in Attachment - Data. A summary of preliminary modeling results illustrates the estimated chinook, coho, and steelhead spawning and rearing habitat potentially available upstream of each crossing, based on measured/modelled channel width and upstream accessible stream length, as presented in Figure 4.2. Detailed information for each site assessed with Phase 2 assessments (including maps) are presented within site specific appendices to this document. table_phase2_overview &lt;- function(dat, caption_text = &#39;&#39;, font = font_set, scroll = TRUE){ dat2 &lt;- dat |&gt; kable(caption = caption_text, booktabs = T, label = NA) |&gt; kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font) |&gt; kableExtra::column_spec(column = c(1:9), width_max = &#39;1in&#39;) # kableExtra::column_spec(column = c(10), width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) if(identical(scroll,TRUE)){ dat2 &lt;- dat2 |&gt; kableExtra::scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;, height = &quot;500px&quot;) } dat2 } tab_overview |&gt; table_phase2_overview(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Overview of habitat confirmation sites. &quot;, sp_rearing_caption), scroll = gitbook_on) Table 4.6: Overview of habitat confirmation sites.

PSCIS ID Stream Road Tenure UTM UTM zone Fish Species Habitat Gain (km) Habitat Value Priority Comments 7622 Burnt Cabin Creek Stella Road MoTI 388735 5997152 10 – 2.0 Medium High A high-quality stream with a relatively steep gradient and abundant functional large woody debris creating steps and pools 20–30mm deep. In some sections, the stream widened and became shallow, with abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Overhead cover was extensive. Near the upper end of the site, the forest had been cleared for pipeline use, resulting in significant bank erosion. and ripiran removal. A large pipe crossed the stream near the pipeline corridor. The stream was surveyed from Stella Road up to the pipeline, ~500m. 199171 Burnt Cabin Creek Gala Bay Road MOTI 388944 5997001 10 – 2.3 Medium High A small stream with good flow and abundant gravels, flowing through several private properties with newly established quad and foot traffic trails. Pools were limited and predominantly shallow. A significant outlet drop was present at the downstream culvert on Gala Bay Road, while the upstream culvert on Stella Road had an even larger drop, both indicating the pipes were undersized for the watershed’s flow capacity. Anecdotal information from a neighboring landowner suggested the stream below Gala Bay Road had been diverted to accommodate a driveway for a recreational property. 199172 Scotch Creek Stella Road MoTi 388269 5996948 10 – 1.6 Medium High The stream provided excellent habitat, with abundant functional large woody debris creating occasional pools 20–30mm deep, suitable for overwintering juvenile fish. Overhead cover was extensive, and occasional gravels were suitable for spawning. A small, broken plastic pipe was present in the first 150m upstream of the culvert, likely a former water intake for adjacent properties. PSCIS crossing 203297 was located 150m upstream of Stella Road on private property, where the culvert had a significant outlet drop, creating a likely fish passage barrier. Approximately 400m upstream, the stream transitioned to a beaver-impounded area with four consecutive 1–1.5m high dams holding back a large volume of water, but flow over or under allowed possible fish passage. The impoundment area extended as far as the surveyed area. A fish (~40mm) was observed after the second beaver dam. The top of the site was marked at WP 400. 199328 Scotch Creek Gala Bay Road MoTi 388380 5996779 10 – – Medium – – 199204 Nine Mile Creek Settlement Road MOTI 403906 5998777 10 RB 36.3 Medium Moderate The stream was a larger system with significant beaver activity, creating impoundments behind dams ranging from 0.3 to 1.5m in height. Heavy cattle use was evident in riparian areas, with trampled banks, extensive browsing of riparian shrubs, and a significant amount of manure within seasonally inundated areas. The survey extended from Settlement Road to a large beaver dam and impoundment. Nutrient loading to the stream appeared high, with large amounts of algae present on the primarily gravel substrates in sections of the channel linking beaver-impounded areas. 199190 Clear Creek Highway 27 MOTI 425557 5996165 10 LKC;LSU 28.8 Medium Moderate The stream had good flow and provided high-quality habitat for the first 100m before beginning to run subsurface. At approximately 200m upstream of the highway, adjacent to a quarry, the stream was fully dewatered to the top of the site. The channel was highly confined and lacked complexity. Although some small and large woody debris were present, they did not appear to function in creating habitat during periods of flow. The stream was primarily a straight channel with a coarse cobble and boulder substrate. A large pile of riprap was placed at the culvert outlet, possibly to reduce the outlet drop, though its placement appeared unusual and could inhibit fish passage. 199232 Beaverley Creek Highway 16 MOti 502374 5962501 10 BB;CAS;CBC;CH;CSU;DV;KO;LNC;LSU;MW;NSC;PCC;RB;RSC;SU 127.8 Medium High A large stream with abundant gravels suitable for Chinook spawning. Pools were infrequent, primarily located on outside bends and behind large woody debris. Some evidence of anthropogenic manipulation was observed, including cut cottonwood trees that had fallen into the channel. The riparian zone was in good condition, with mature shrub communities and old-growth cottonwood that should contribute to future habitat complexity. The culvert appeared to have been modified in the past to attempt backwatering, with boulder lines present downstream. Heavy rainfall over the previous evening and preceding weeks had raised water levels to moderate conditions. The stream was a major tributary to the Chilako River, with documented Chinook presence. The watershed was within Prince George city limits, presenting opportunities for community engagement, trail network development, educational programs, and stewardship initiatives. A significant slump on the highway approximately 300m upstream of the culvert was actively eroding; however, a healthy young deciduous and shrub-dominated riparian zone at this location likely provided some filtration and protection of water quality. 199256 Kenneth Creek Highway 16 MOTI 582279 5975090 10 BT;CC;CCG;CH;LSU;RB 88.4 High High The stream was large and gravel-dominated, with extensive deep runs, deep pools, large woody debris, and multiple channels throughout. Gravels were suitable for Chinook and resident salmonid spawning. A Chinook spawner was observed upstream of the culvert in 2022. Heavy rains over the past two weeks had significantly raised water levels. A beaver dam was present within side channels at the upper end of the surveyed site. The riparian area was intact throughout, consisting of a mix of shrub-dominated wetland areas and mature mixed forest. 199260 Tributary To Sugarbowl Creek Highway 16 MOTI 587916 5972449 10 – 0.9 High High The stream was a larger, steeper system with intact, mature coniferous cedar-hemlock riparian cover, primarily stable banks, and abundant large woody debris throughout. A step-pool morphology was present, with pools up to 80cm deep. Numerous debris jam steps ranged from 30–60cm. Habitat appeared suitable for large bull trout spawning and rearing. 199255 Tributary To Kenneth Creek Bowron FSR MoF 578664 5972996 10 LSU 1.6 Medium Moderate Small stream with good flow and abundant gravels suitable for bull trout and cutthroat trout spawning. Occasional shallow pools provided habitat for juvenile salmonid rearing. Banks were stable, with an intact mixed mature forest. The stream had some short sections with gradients up to 5% but was primarily a low-gradient riffle-gravel system. 199267 Driscoll Creek Highway 16 MoTi 606378 5965782 10 CCG;RB 12.5 Medium Moderate The stream was a low-gradient, gravel-dominated system with an extensive shrub-sedge wetland area and beaver activity in the lower 200m. Deep pools up to 1m were present throughout, influenced by abundant large woody debris contributed from the adjacent mature, primarily coniferous forest. The stream was surveyed for 600m upstream of the highway, and the west fork was surveyed. 199237 Snowshoe Creek Highway 16 MoTi 650786 5934862 10 EB;LKC;RB;RSC;ST 25.2 High Moderate The stream was surveyed upstream for 750m, following the west fork at the junction. The east fork was surveyed separately (13900100_us2). The stream was a large, low-gradient gravel riffle-pool system with abundant large woody debris throughout. Banks were stable, with an intact mature coniferous riparian zone. High flows due to heavy rains over the past two weeks made pool delineation difficult, so residual depth was estimated. Gravel and small cobbles were present, likely suitable for Chinook spawning. Extensive areas of high-value habitat were observed for juvenile rearing and resident salmonid spawning. 199174 Tributary To Nechako River Sutherland FSR MoF 397160 5996574 10 SP 4.2 – High Medium-value habitat. The stream had been heavily impacted by cattle throughout the surveyed area, with evidence of bank trampling and extensive low-gradient muddy sections. Upstream of the culvert, the stream was primarily dry for the first 300m, with young forest and shrubs. At this point, intermittent pools began to appear, associated with beaver activity. At approximately 450–500m upstream, the stream became almost entirely watered, with pools up to 40cm deep. Many surveyed areas resembled wetland habitat, with spirea, willow, alder, and trembling aspen throughout. The last 200m of the stream was incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, as it flowed more directly southeast to join the Nechako River rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River. 199173 Tributary To Nechako River Dog Creek Road MOTI 398923 5996362 10 SP 6.2 Medium High Heavy cattle impacts were observed throughout the surveyed area, with the most pronounced damage in low-gradient sections with easily accessible banks. The stream changed character at a beaver dam located approximately 300–350m upstream, transitioning from a channelized stream to beaver-impounded wetland areas. A fence intended to restrict cattle access had been breached. A series of beaver dams began approximately 300m upstream of the road, with over three dams observed, some up to 1.5m high. The dams were mature, well-developed, and had vegetation growing through them. Fish were observed throughout the survey area. The habitat was of medium value for rearing rainbow trout and potentially Chinook, with some pockets of gravels present. However, heavy cattle impacts had led to significant sedimentation, with fines covering much of the substrate. The beaver dams were impounding large quantities of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow downstream at the Dog Creek Road crossing. Waypoints were taken for a breached fence line (WP 32), a slumped historic road (WP 33), and the first beaver dam (WP 34). The last 200m of the stream was incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, as it flowed more directly southeast to join the Nechako River rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River. 199282 Holliday Creek Highway 16 MOTI 305946 5896010 11 – 20.7 High Moderate A large glaciated system with a cobble-boulder substrate and an intact mixed riparian zone, primarily deciduous. Occasional large woody debris features created deep pool habitats and likely gravel tailouts. The system had a lower gradient, with occasional pockets of gravels suitable for spawning salmonids ranging from 20cm to 100cm in size. The Holliday Creek Arch Protected Area is located upstream, accessed by a 8km trail from the highway. 199278 Teepee Creek Highway 5 MOTI 344031 5862744 11 SA 0.5 High High The stream was surveyed from the highway to the railway and was a mid-sized, steeper cobble-boulder step-pool system with only rare pockets of unembedded gravels. Deep pools were present, formed by boulder and large woody debris scour. A salmon point was noted near the pipeline location in FISS. Numerous small steps ranging from 30–60cm were present due to the steep, boulder-dominated nature of the stream. 203302 Teepee Creek Railway CN Rail 344222 5862742 11 – 0.3 Medium Moderate The site was surveyed from the railway up to PSCIS crossing 4931, where gradients increased significantly, indicating a new reach should begin. Approximately 100m before the end of the site, the stream showed signs of a large disturbance event that had incised the channel to a depth of 1.2–2m, with major areas of aggregation where the channel was widened and uniform. Teepee Creek Trail was reported to cross the stream within the site, but it was not observed during the survey. Substrates were embedded, with very rare areas of unembedded gravels. Due to heavy rain in the days prior to the survey, conditions were slightly turbid, making it difficult to assess the full extent of gravels, particularly within the tailouts of plunge pools. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary(dat = pscis_phase2) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Summary of Phase 2 fish passage reassessments.&#39;, scroll = gitbook_on) Table 4.7: Summary of Phase 2 fish passage reassessments.

See Table 3.1 for modelling thresholds. "],["recommendations.html", "5 Recommendations", " 5 Recommendations A major challenge in advancing fish passage restoration is the complexity of working across jurisdictions and with multiple stakeholders—rail and highway authorities, forestry ministries, licensees, and private landowners. These partners are often being asked to accommodate priorities that originate outside their mandates and budgets. Convincing them to invest in difficult, high-cost interventions—like modifying crossings or relocating infrastructure—requires navigating uncertainty about costs and ecological outcomes, as well as a disconnect between the benefits to watershed health and the internal pressures or performance goals of these agencies. It’s a tough ask: to take on massive, uncertain projects when they’re already stretched thin with their own responsibilities. Fish passage restoration within the Upper Fraser River and across British Columbia is further complicated by the legacy of infrastructure deeply embedded in the landscape. Roads, railways, highways, community infrastructure and private assets often constrain floodplains and disrupt natural hydrological processes. While targeted repairs to individual barriers are essential, they won’t resolve the broader systemic issues without rethinking and restructuring how infrastructure interacts with watershed function. Loss of riparian vegetation and intensive beaver management only add to the degradation. Addressing these challenges means making strategic, well-communicated choices—picking battles carefully, building trust, and staying committed to a longer-term transformation. While preliminary top remediation priorities are provided by watershed group, these rankings are inherently subjective and can depend on the capacity and willingness of infrastructure owners and tenure holders to support implementation—both financially and over the often multi-year project timelines. In practice, we must often act opportunistically, pursuing simpler, lower-cost options to maintain momentum and achieve near-term progress. Government, community groups, landowners, non-profits, industry and other stakeholders should work collaboratively to address high and moderate priority barriers identified in Table 4.2. Although the table presents many options, linked reports specify whether each site is a low, moderate, or high priority. Progress on any front is meaningful, and aiming to remediate at least one high-priority site per year per watershed group—regardless of its overall rank—is a practical and effective approach. Recommendations for collaborative enhancement of fish passage restoration in the Upper Fraser River Region include: Maintain strong partnerships to support funding, site selection, remediation, and monitoring through adaptive management informed by traditional knowledge and real-time data. Coordinate with the Ministry of Transportation to pursue funding for engineering designs at the following crossings: PSCIS crossing 199171 on Burnt Cabin Creek along Gala Bay Road, in the Francois Lake watershed group. PSCIS crossing 199173 on a tributary to the Nechako River, on Dog Creek Road, in the Nechako River watershed group Use climate modeling to prioritize crossings that enable access to cold, drought-resistant habitats. Integrate fish passage restoration planning with other restoration and enhancement initiatives in the region to maximize benefits to fish populations as well as for communities within the Upper Fraser River watershed. This includes working with the Rivershed Society of BC, Nechako Environment and Watershed Stewardship Society (NEWSS), University of Northern British Columbia, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Ministry of Transportation, provincial regulators, and others to leverage funding, knowledge, and resources for fish passage restoration towards other projects related to watershed health in the region. Examples of where this is already taking in place in other watersheds includes: Leveraging of Morice River watershed group fish passage sites into the Bii Wenii Kwa Restoration/Recovery Plan Incorporation of Upper Bulkley River sites into the Neexdzii Kwah Restoration Planning (Irvine and Schick 2025a). Develop strategies to explore cost and fisheries production benefits of stream crossing structure upgrades alongside alternative/additional restoration and enhancement investments such as land conservation/procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, water treatment and research. Ideentify and pursue opportunities to collaborate and leverage initiatives together in study area watersheds (ex. fish passage rehabilitation, riparian restoration and cattle exclusion) for maximum likely restoration benefits.

The stream name Burnt Cabin Creek is the local name for the waterway as it is not named within the freshwater atlas. Crossing 199171 is located 50m upstream of Fraser Lake, on Gala Bay Road - and approximately 275m further upstream, PSCIS crossing 7622 is located on Stella Road. Both crossings are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1790951 and 1794196). The recently completed Coastal Gaslink pipeline crosses the stream approximately 500m upstream of Stella Road. my_caption &lt;- &quot;Map of Burnt Cabin Creek&quot; knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/gis/map_burnt_cabin.jpeg&quot;) Figure 5.1: Map of Burnt Cabin Creek Background At the location of these crossings, Burnt Cabin Creek is a third order stream and drains a watershed of approximately 4.5km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1237m to 683m near the lower crossing (Table 5.1). PSCIS crossing 7622 was first assessed with a fish passage assessment in 2004 under the project name “2004 BC Conservation Corp Assessments, DRV” (MoE 2023). Background documentation could not be sourced. Both crossings 199171 and 7622 were reassessed in 2023 and prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of a significant amount of modelled habitat as well as habitat rated as medium value during the 2004 assessment. A habitat confirmation assessment encompassing both sites was conducted in 2024. No fisheries information is documented for the stream; however, downstream in Fraser Lake, white sturgeon, rainbow trout, kokanee, sockeye salmon, chinook salmon, bull trout, dolly varden, and other species have been previously recorded (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024). During the site visit to Gala Bay Road, an adjacent landowner reported observing adult sockeye along the shoreline near the confluence of the stream and Fraser Lake in the past. They also mentioned that the stream flows year-round, even in dry years, fed by a spring emerging from the mountainside at the headwaters and that the stream below Gala Bay Road had been diverted to accommodate a driveway for a recreational property.

The stream was highly channelized due to residential properties on both sides. The habitat was rated as medium with minimal cover and few pools suitable for fish, but gravels were present for spawning. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.The average channel width was 2.4m, the average wetted width was 1.4m, and the average gradient was 1.3%. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199171 and Downstream of Crossing 7622 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199171 for 275m , all the way to crossing 7622 on Stella Road (Figure 5.4). The average channel width was 2.4m, the average wetted width was 1.2m, and the average gradient was 4.5%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant. The habitat was rated as medium value, with good flow and abundant gravels, flowing through several private properties with newly established quad and foot traffic trails. Pools were limited and predominantly shallow. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 7622 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 7622 for 500m to the pipeline right of way (Figure 5.5). The habitat was rated as high value with relatively steep gradients and abundant functional large woody debris creating steps and pools 20 – 30cm deep. In some sections, the stream widened and became shallow, with abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Overhead cover was extensive. Near the upper end of the site, the forest had been cleared for pipeline use, resulting in significant bank erosion and riparian removal (Figure 5.6). The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.The average channel width was 3.5m, the average wetted width was 1.4m, and the average gradient was 7%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Gala Bay Road crossing (199171) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 1,500,000. As the stream width is relatively narrow installation of a streambed simulation culvert could be considered with costs estimated as significantly lower than a bridge. Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Stella Road crossing (7622) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. This culvert had a 1.15m outlet drop, very likely inhibiting fish passage. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 3,000,000. Conclusion Burnt Cabin Creek is a small stream that flows into Fraser Lake. The historic observation of an adult sockeye along the shoreline of the lake near the stream’s confluence with Fraser Lake combined with the stream’s apparently perennial and groundwater-influenced flow, highlights the site may be located near sockeye shoreline spawning habitat, indicating high ecological and cultural importance for the area. The downstream crossing on Gala Bay Road had a 0.9m outlet drop, while the Stella Road crossing had a 1.2m outlet drop, both of which are likely completely inhibiting upstream fish passage for all life stages of fish that would be present. Both crossings are considered high priorities for replacement with the acquisition of an engineering design and replacement cost estimate recommended for the downstream crossing. Fish sampling is recommended to determine fish presence and community composition upstream and downstream of both the Gala Bay Road site as well as the Stella Road crossing. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site, my_site2)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings &quot;, my_site, &quot; and &quot;, my_site2, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.5: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings 199171 and 7622.

Stream Characteristics at Crossings 199328 and 199172 At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing 199328 on Gala Bay Road was embedded, 100% backwatered, and ranked as passable to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 5.8). Further upstream, PSCIS crossing 199172 on Stella Road was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 5.9). This culvert had a significant 1.35m outlet drop. In 2024, a third crossing (PSCIS 203297) was assessed on a private road approximately 150m upstream of Stella Road, with results provided in Table 5.10. Two pipes were present, with the larger culvert having a significant 0.7m outlet drop. The inlet side of the road had completely eroded into the stream, obscuring the inlet from view. The road was heavily overgrown, collapsing, and appeared to be unused. Water temperature was 5\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.8 and conductivity was 208 uS/cm. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.8: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 199328.

There was a 0.7m outlet drop, and only the larger pipe conveyed flow. The inlet side of the road had completely eroded into the stream, obstructing the view of the inlet. No light was visible through the culverts from the outlet side, though water was still flowing. A landowner had placed a barricade across the road, likely to prevent access due to severe erosion of the road. The stream provided high-quality habitat with abundant large woody debris creating pools and gravels suitable for spawning. Just downstream, a functioning water intake shack was located in the middle of the stream, likely supplying the adjacent landowner’s property. Plastic pipes extended from the intake shack downstream to the lower Stella Road crossing. The heavily overgrown and collapsing road appeared to be private access and would be a good candidate for removal. Due to inlet erosion, culvert length and slope were estimated as the inlet could not be located.

The stream was small, low-gradient, and gravel-dominated, with habitat rated as medium value for spawning and rearing. Channelization with riprap was present near the upstream end of the survey and again near the mouth at Fraser Lake. A possible algal bloom was observed along the lake shoreline (Figure 5.9). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as .The average channel width was 2.9m, the average wetted width was 1.6m, and the average gradient was 1.8%.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199328 and Downstream of Crossing 199172 The stream was surveyed from Gala Bay Road upstream to Stella Road, a distance of approximately 270m (Figure 5.10). The habitat was rated as medium value, with limited pools; however, abundant overhanging vegetation and small woody debris provided cover, and gravels suitable for resident salmonid spawning were present. Incision was evident, beginning with a deep cut at the culvert outlet under Stella Road and continuing downstream to Gala Bay Road. The riparian area was generally intact through most of the survey, except for the downstream 75m, where private land development on the north side had resulted in a lawn and riparian vegetation removal up to the channel edge. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks.The average channel width was 2.1m, the average wetted width was 1.3m, and the average gradient was 3%. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199172 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199172 for 550m (Figure 5.11). The habitat was rated as medium value, with abundant functional large woody debris creating pools 20 – 30cm deep, suitable for overwintering juvenile fish. Overhead cover was extensive, and occasional gravels were suitable for spawning. Approximately 400m upstream of Stella Road, the stream transitioned into a beaver-impounded area with four consecutive dams (1 – 1.5m high) impounding a large volume of water. Flow was maintained over or under the dams and the impounded area extended to the upper end of the surveyed area. A fish (~40mm) was observed after the second dam. The average channel width was 2.6m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 4.3%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant. PSCIS crossing 203297 was located approximately 150m upstream of Stella Road on a private road, where the culvert had a significant outlet drop, severe erosion at the inlet, and the road was collapsing. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate At the time of reporting in 2025, crossing 199328 on Gala Bay Road was ranked as passable to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol and no remediation is required (MoE 2011). Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed upstream, replacement of the Stella Road crossing (199172) with a bridge (18 m span) is recommended. This culvert had a 1.35m outlet drop, very likely inhibiting fish passage. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 3,600,000. Further upstream, PSCIS crossing 203297 was located on a private road that appeared unused and was collapsing. With a 0.7m outlet drop, the site is a strong candidate for deactivation or removal. Follow-up engagement with the landowners is recommended to assess interest in restoration or road deactivation. Conclusion Scotch Creek is a small stream that flows into Fraser Lake, with a documented chinook observation from 2018 near the outflow into the lake (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024). The downstream crossing on Gala Bay Road was ranked as passable; however, PSCIS crossing 199172 on Stella Road had a significant 1.35m outlet drop and presented a clear barrier to upstream fish passage. Fish sampling is recommended to determine whether fish are able to ascend past the Stella Road crossing. The crossing is a high priority for replacement. A further 150m upstream of Stella Road, PSCIS crossing 203297 was an additional barrier to fish passage, with a 0.7m outlet drop and severe erosion obstructing the inlet. The road was heavily overgrown and collapsing, appeared to be unused, and would be a strong candidate for deactivation and removal. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site, my_site2)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings &quot;, my_site, &quot; and &quot;, my_site2, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.11: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings 199328 and 199172.

Crossing 199173 is located 115m upstream of the Nechako River, on Dog Creek Road, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1794340). A further 2km upstream, PSCIS crossing 199174 is located on Sutherland FSR and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Forests. The downstream 200m of the stream is incorrectly mapped in the BC Freshwater Atlas, and flows directly south to join the Nechako River (see Survey Track in Figure 5.12) rather than following the mapped route, which runs east along Dog Creek Road before joining the Nechako River. my_caption &lt;- &quot;Map of tributary to Nechako River&quot; knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/gis/map_trib_to_nechako.jpeg&quot;) Figure 5.12: Map of tributary to Nechako River Background At the location of these crossings, Tributary To Nechako River is a third order stream and drains a watershed of approximately 15km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1191m to 680m near the downstream crossing (Table 5.12). Since 2020, an ongoing environmental DNA (eDNA) project led by Dr. Brent Murray and Barry Booth, R.P.Bio at UNBC, in collaboration with School District (SD) 91, has conducted fish sampling in the Nechako River watershed, including on Tributary To Nechako River. Minnow trapping in 2022 captured chinook just upstream of the crossing on Dog Creek Road (Booth 2023). Additionally, minnow trapping in 2021 and 2023 captured chinook in the ~100m section of stream from Dog Creek Road downstream to the Nechako River (Booth 2022, 2024), with eDNA results from 2021 and 2023 also showing a strong detection for chinook in this section (B. Murray and Booth 2024; B. W. Murray and Booth 2023). In 2023, both crossings were assessed with fish passage assessments and prioritized for follow-up in 2024 based on the presence of high-value habitat adjacent to Dog Creek Road and supporting information from B. Murray and Booth (2024) and B. W. Murray and Booth (2023). Habitat confirmation assessments were completed at both sites in 2024. A third site, PSCIS crossing 199332, was also assessed in 2023. Located approximately 1.7km upstream of the Sutherland FSR crossing on Williams FSR, the site consisted of a bridge with evidence of extensive cattle trampling below. Assessment results from 2023 are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos.

The habitat was rated as medium value, with undercut banks suitable for juvenile chinook and rainbow trout rearing. No natural or man-made barriers were present between Dog Creek Road and the Nechako River. Fish (~40 – 90mm in length) were observed during the assessment. The average channel width was 3.5m, the average wetted width was 1.3m, and the average gradient was 6%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and boulders.The dominant substrate was cobbles with fines sub-dominant. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199173 and Downstream of Crossing 199174 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199173 for 575m (Figure 5.16). The habitat was rated as medium with pockets of gravels suitable for rainbow trout and potentially chinook rearing, and fish were observed throughout the survey area. Heavy cattle impacts were evident, particularly in low-gradient sections with easily accessible banks. Fencing intended to restrict cattle access was present but had been breached. Approximately 300–350m upstream, the stream transitioned from a channelized section to a beaver-impounded wetland, with over three mature dams — some up to 1.5m high — vegetated and well-developed. These dams impounded large volumes of water, likely sustaining year-round stream flow downstream at the Dog Creek Road crossing. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 3m, the average wetted width was 1.5m, and the average gradient was 2.4%. The stream was surveyed downstream from crossing 199174 for 300m (Figure 5.17). The stream was intermittent for the first ~70m before transitioning into a beaver-impacted wetland area. Approximately 250m downstream of Sutherland FSR, several large, mature, consecutive beaver dams were present and appeared to continue as far as the area surveyed. Signs of cattle trampling were observed throughout the stream, and the channel frequently split into several smaller channels. The habitat was rated as medium value, with few gravels for spawning but abundant pools created by beaver dams. The average channel width was 2m, the average wetted width was 1m, and the average gradient was 1.2%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199174 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199174 for 650m (Figure 5.18). The habitat was rated as medium value and had been heavily impacted by cattle, with evidence of bank trampling and extensive low-gradient muddy sections. Upstream of the culvert, the stream was primarily dry for the first 300m, with young forest and shrub riparian. At this point, intermittent pools began to appear, associated with beaver activity. At approximately 450 – 500m upstream, the stream became almost entirely watered, with pools up to 40cm deep. Many surveyed areas resembled wetland habitat, with spirea, willow, alder, and trembling aspen throughout. The average channel width was 2.5m, the average wetted width was 0.9m, and the average gradient was 1.2%.The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and overhanging vegetation. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Dog Creek Road crossing (199173) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 1,500,000. At the time of assessment, the upstream crossing on Sutherland FSR was unlikely a barrier to fish passage, and restoration efforts should prioritize the downstream crossing on Dog Creek Road. However, should restoration activities proceed at crossing 199174, replacement with a bridge spanning 15 m is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the estimated cost for the replacement is $ 450,000. Conclusion Minnow trapping and eDNA sampling have confirmed the presence of chinook upstream and downstream of the Dog Creek Road crossing as recently as 2023 (Booth 2023; B. W. Murray and Booth 2023). Medium value habitat was observed throughout the sections of stream surveyed from Dog Creek Road to Sutherland FSR. No natural or man-made barriers were present between Dog Creek Road and the Nechako River, and the stream provided high value habitat in this section. At the time of assessment, the upstream crossing on Sutherland FSR (PSCIS 199174) was unlikely a barrier to fish passage, and restoration efforts should prioritize the downstream crossing on Dog Creek Road (PSCIS 199173), which had a significant outlet drop and is a high priority for replacement. Heavy cattle activity in the stream was observed throughout the surveyed area upstream of Dog Creek Road and Sutherland FSR, consistent with observations documented by Booth (2023). Tributary To Nechako River presents an opportunity for riparian restoration to exclude cattle from the stream through measures such as fencing and the installation of offsite watering systems. Landowner engagement through education and restoration initiatives should be explored to improve riparian function, reduce cattle inputs, and enhance fish habitat quality. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site, my_site2)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings &quot;, my_site, &quot; and &quot;, my_site2, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.16: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings 199173 and 199174.

The crossing is located 8.3km upstream of the Nechako River, on Highway 27, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1806163). my_caption &lt;- &quot;Map of Clear Creek&quot; knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/gis/map_clear.jpeg&quot;) Figure 5.19: Map of Clear Creek Background At PSCIS crossing 199190, Clear Creek is a third order stream and drains a watershed of approximately 54.9km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 987m to 730m near the crossing (Table 5.17). Since 2020, an ongoing environmental DNA (eDNA) project led by Dr. Brent Murray and Barry Booth at UNBC, in collaboration with School District (SD) 91, has been conducting fish sampling in the Nechako River watershed, including on Clear Creek. In the lower section of Clear Creek, downstream of Braeside Road, chinook salmon were repeatedly documented through sampling efforts in 2020, 2022, and 2023 (Booth 2023; B. W. Murray and Booth 2023). Upstream of PSCIS crossing 199296, located on a tributary to Clear Creek, coho salmon were detected using eDNA sampling in 2023 (B. W. Murray and Booth 2023). Further upstream on Clear Creek above crossing 199190 on Highway 27, longnose sucker and lake chub have previously been recorded (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024). Motivated by these findings, and in addition to a historical chinook salmon observation recorded downstream of Highway 27 in the FISS database (MoE 2024), several crossings within the Clear Creek system were assessed with fish passage assessments in 2023 with results found in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. Crossing 199187 on Braeside Road was fully backwatered and passable, as well as crossing 199296 located on a tributary to Clear Creek which joins above Braeside Road (Figure 5.19). On the mainstem of Clear Creek, crossing 199190 on Highway 27 was ranked as a barrier, noted as being in poor condition, and was prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat. A habitat confirmation assessment encompassing crossing 199190 was subsequently conducted in 2024. Additionally, there is Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data available for Clear Creek presented in Table 2.1 of the background section.

Comments: The bottom of the culvert had been reinforced with concrete, likely to address holes noted in the previous assessment. A large pile of riprap was placed at the outlet, possibly to reduce the outlet drop, though its placement appeared unusual and could inhibit fish passage. The habitat was high quality, with a large pool just downstream of the culvert and abundant gravels suitable for spawning fish.

The habitat was rated as high value for salmonid spawning and rearing. The stream contained frequent pools suitable for overwintering fish, with abundant cobbles but limited gravels. Evidence of extreme seasonal flows was observed, including large eroding banks, extensive gravel deposits from channel widening (20 – 30m), and significant log jams. The average channel width was 5.4m, the average wetted width was 4m, and the average gradient was 1.2%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks.The dominant substrate was cobbles with fines sub-dominant. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199190 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199190 for 550m (Figure 5.21). The habitat was rated as low value. Although the stream had good flow and provided high-quality habitat for the first 100m, it then transitioning to subsurface flow. Approximately 200m upstream of the highway, adjacent to a quarry, the stream was fully dewatered to the top of the surveyed area. The channel was highly confined, lacked complexity, and consisted primarily of a straight, coarse cobble and boulder substrate. While some small and large woody debris were present, they did not appear to contribute to habitat formation during periods of flow. Total cover amount was rated as trace with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 5.2m, the average wetted width was 3.1m, and the average gradient was 1.3%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Highway 27 crossing (199190) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 11,250,000. Conclusion The habitat upstream of PSCIS crossing 199190 on Highway 27 was documented as low value for salmonid spawning and rearing, and the crossing is rated as a low priority for replacement due to the intermittent nature of the stream approximately 200m upstream of the crossing. The culvert had been recently worked on, with new cement poured inside the pipe and riprap placed at the outlet. However, fish sampling to determine whether fish are utilizing the ~200m of wetted stream upstream of the crossing would still be beneficial. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.20: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 199190.

The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1317m to 754m near the crossing (Table 5.21). Since 2020, an ongoing environmental DNA (eDNA) project led by Dr. Brent Murray and Barry Booth at UNBC, in collaboration with School District (SD) 91, has been conducting fish sampling in the Nechako River watershed, including on Nine Mile Creek. Minnow trapping by Booth (2022) in 2021 captured chinook just downstream of this crossing but not upstream, despite the presence of suitable habitat. The study suggested that these culverts may be a barrier to further upstream movement of chinook (Booth 2022). eDNA results from 2021 showed a strong detection for chinook immediately downstream of the Settlement Road crossing, while 2023 results showed a weaker detection at the same location (B. Murray and Booth 2024; B. W. Murray and Booth 2023). Additionally, a strong detection for chinook was observed near the confluence of Nine Mile Creek and the Nechako River in 2023 (B. W. Murray and Booth 2023). Based on these findings, in 2023, crossing 199204 on Settlement Road was assessed with a fish passage assessment and prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat.

The habitat was rated as high value, with good stream flow, frequent deep pools suitable for overwintering fish, and abundant spawning gravels. Significant beaver activity was observed, including old and active dams blocking both culverts on Settlement Road. The first 150m showed signs of cattle trampling, with numerous small trails crossing the stream. Approximately 300m downstream of Settlement Road, the stream had been artificially entrenched, creating a large backwatered pool with water pipes leading in, likely related to the adjacent cut block (Figure 5.24). Despite modifications, the stream remained well-defined, providing excellent fish habitat. The east side of the stream bordered a cut block with a 30 – 50m buffer zone. One small fish (~40mm) was observed during the survey. Total cover amount was rated as abundant with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris and deep pools.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.The average channel width was 5.5m, the average wetted width was 3.6m, and the average gradient was 0.8%. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199204 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199204 for 425m (Figure 5.25). The habitat was rated as medium value for spawning and rearing. The stream was a larger system with significant beaver activity, creating impoundments behind dams ranging from 0.3 - 1.5m in height. Heavy cattle use was evident in riparian areas, with trampled banks, extensive browsing of riparian shrubs, and a significant amount of manure within seasonally inundated areas. Nutrient loading to the stream appeared high, with large amounts of algae present on the primarily gravel substrates in sections of the channel linking beaver-impounded areas. The dominant substrate was fines with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, overhanging vegetation, and instream vegetation.The average channel width was 6.2m, the average wetted width was 4.4m, and the average gradient was 3%. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Settlement Road crossing (199204) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 1,500,000. Conclusion Nine Mile Creek is a tributary to the Nechako River and a known chinook system, with chinook captured immediately downstream of the crossing in 2021 and detected through eDNA sampling as recently as 2023 (Booth 2022; B. W. Murray and Booth 2023). Medium value habitat was observed upstream of the crossing, with bcfishpass modeling indicating 8km of potential chinook spawning habitat and 16km of potential coho spawning habitat upstream. Downstream provided excellent fish habitat with good stream flow, frequent deep pools suitable for overwintering fish, and abundant spawning gravels. Beaver activity and heavy cattle use was observed both upstream and downstream of the crossing. The culverts had a moderate outlet drop, and the crossing is a moderate priority for replacement. Given the species present in the system and the outlet drops at both crossings, fish sampling is recommended to determine whether the culverts are impeding fish passage. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.24: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 199204.

The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1079m to 638m near the crossing (Table 5.25). In 2023, PSCIS crossing 199232 on Highway 16 was assessed with a fish passage assessment and prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat and several historical chinook observations documented downstream in the FISS database (MoE 2024). A habitat confirmation assessment was subsequently conducted in 2024. Several other crossings were assessed within the Beaverley Creek system in 2023, with results detailed in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos.

The pipe on the north side was not flowing. The gradient directly downstream of the culvert was 3-4% due to boulders placed to create backwatering, which was somewhat functioning, though the culverts were not fully backwatered, but water levels were elevated. The rest of the stream had a gradient of 0.5%. The stream provided good habitat but was fairly channelized due to residential development on both sides. Signs of high flows were evident, with eroding banks. Few pools and limited functional large woody debris were present.

The habitat was rated as medium value due to sparse large woody debris, a lack of pools, and high turbidity from recent rainfall likely obscuring gravels. Below the outlet, large boulders were placed in rows to backwater the culvert, which was somewhat effective, though the culvert itself remained unbackwatered. This section had a steeper gradient (3 – 4%) before transitioning to ~0.5% for the remainder of the area surveyed. The upper section of the stream was somewhat channelized due to residences on both sides, while lower sections showed significant bank erosion. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as boulders.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 9.6m, the average wetted width was 6m, and the average gradient was 2%. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199232 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199232 for 725m (Figure 5.28). The habitat was rated as high value, with abundant gravels suitable for chinook spawning. Pools were infrequent, primarily located on outside bends and behind large woody debris. Some evidence of anthropogenic manipulation was observed, including cut cottonwood trees that had fallen into the channel. The riparian zone was in good condition, with mature shrub communities and old-growth cottonwood that should contribute to future habitat complexity. Water levels were elevated to moderate conditions due to heavy rainfall over the previous evening and preceding weeks. The average channel width was 11.9m, the average wetted width was 8m, and the average gradient was 0.6%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and boulders.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Highway 16 crossing (199232) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 11,250,000. Conclusion Beaverley Creek is a large stream and a major tributary to the Chilako River, with documented chinook observations downstream, most recently in 2010 (Godfreyson 2010). The areas surveyed upstream provided high-value habitat for chinook spawning, with bcfishpass modeling indicating ~11km of potential chinook and ~47km of potential coho spawning habitat upstream. Both culverts had a significant outlet drop, and the crossing is a high priority for replacement. The watershed is within Prince George city limits, presenting opportunities for community engagement, trail network development, educational programs, and stewardship initiatives. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.28: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 199232.

Conclusion PSCIS crossing 199237 on Highway 16 had a significant outlet drop and is a moderate priority for replacement. Downstream of Highway 16, chinook have historically spawned at the confluence of Snowshoe Creek and the Fraser River (Salmon Watersheds Program 2025), indicating this stream has provided valuable spawning habitat. Given that the habitat upstream of Highway 16 was rated as high value for spawning and rearing during the 2024 assessment, fish sampling is recommended to further assess whether the crossing is inhibiting fish passage. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.32: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 199237.

The habitat was rated as low value for spawning and rearing with no gravels or cobbles observed and the substrate consisting entirely of fine mud. Fish habitat was limited, with very few pools present. The first 130m of the stream was a beaver-affected area, with a beaver dam approximately 0.7m high located ~40m downstream of the culvert. The dam had flooded the surrounding forest, with no main channel observed. Occasional sections had a somewhat defined channel, but the majority of the surveyed area consisted of water flowing through a wet forest. The dominant substrate was fines with fines sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and instream vegetation.The average channel width was 10.3m, the average wetted width was 7m, and the average gradient was 0.8%.. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199255 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199255 for 650m (Figure 5.34). The habitat was rated as medium value with good flow and abundant gravels suitable for bull trout and cutthroat trout spawning. Occasional shallow pools provided habitat for juvenile salmonid rearing. Banks were stable, with an intact mixed mature forest. The stream was small and had some short sections with gradients up to 5% but was primarily a low-gradient riffle-gravel system. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 3.4m, the average wetted width was 2.8m, and the average gradient was 2.8%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, and overhanging vegetation. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Bowron FSR crossing (199255) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 450,000. Conclusion Although the culvert ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011), blockage due to beaver activity is a greater issue than the culvert itself. The outlet was plugged with beaver sticks, and it appeared the beaver had dammed the culvert entirely, creating a large pond upstream with the inlet completely submerged. Despite this, some flow remained. The habitat surveyed downstream was low value but could change if beaver activity decreased; however, most of the area consisted of water flowing through a wet forest with a substrate of fine mud. Upstream habitat was rated as medium value, with good flow and abundant gravels suitable for bull trout and cutthroat trout spawning, making the crossing a moderate priority for replacement. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.36: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 199255.

The crossing is located 9.8km upstream of the confluence of Kenneth Creek and the Fraser River. The crossing is situated on Highway 16, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_hwy_structure_road_id: 3750). The headwaters and confluence of Kenneth Creek overlap the Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Provincial Park which is within the traditional territory of the Lheidli T’enneh (Figure 5.35). The park protects a significant area of old-growth interior cedar-hemlock forest, provides high-quality habitat for wildlife, including grizzly bear, marten, and caribou, and serves as an important movement corridor for caribou. Additionally, the area features a trail system that supports popular alpine backcountry recreation opportunities near Prince George (“Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Park” n.d.; “Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Cabins – PGBRS” n.d.). my_caption &lt;- &quot;Map of Kenneth Creek&quot; knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/gis/map_kenneth.jpeg&quot;) Figure 5.35: Map of Kenneth Creek Background At PSCIS crossing 199256, Kenneth Creek is a fifth order stream and drains a watershed of approximately 172km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1886m to 655m near the crossing (Table 5.37). The Kenneth Creek watershed was assessed in detail using Fish Habitat Assessment Procedures (FHAP) in 1997 by AquaFor Consulting Ltd (AquaFor Consulting Ltd 1998). Extensive degradation due to past forest harvesting was noted, with much of the watershed lacking future inputs of functional large woody debris—an element critical for maintaining channel and bank stability, diversifying habitat, and reducing stream velocities. Field observations indicated that the lower 15 reaches provide extremely valuable habitat for chinook salmon, and are also important for bull trout and rainbow trout. These reaches were all found to be severely impacted by past harvesting, with the most negative and cumulative impacts occurring where stream crossings were improperly located or poorly deactivated (if at all). AquaFor Consulting Ltd (1998) stated that although impacts varied across reaches, the system is actively degrading, and if restorative costs are to be best implemented, it should be done immediately to a system which is partially functioning, thereby most effectively minimizing costs and reducing the risks associated with failure of restorative activities. In 2006, PSCIS crossing 199256 on Highway 16 was assessed with a fish passage assessment by DWB Forestry Services Ltd. and documented as a partial barrier due to high water velocities and an 8cm outlet drop (Hooft 2006). The culvert constricted the channel to less than half its natural width; however, upstream habitat was noted as high value, with chinook captured both upstream and downstream of the crossing. Hooft (2006) noted that although adult chinook salmon and rainbow trout could ascend at the observed velocities, they were likely impeded during higher spring flows. Given the background information for this stream, in 2023, crossing 199256 was assessed with a fish passage assessment and prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat and chinook observations documented downstream in the FISS database (MoE 2024). Additionally, a dead chinook spawner was observed upstream of the Highway 16 culvert during an informal site visit in 2022. A habitat confirmation assessment was subsequently conducted in 2024. In addition to chinook captured upstream of Highway 16 by Hooft (2006), longnose sucker, rainbow trout, chinook salmon, bull trout, sculpin (general), and slimy sculpin have previously been recorded (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024). Also, there is Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data available for Kenneth Creek presented in Table 2.1 of the background section. Water level, water temperature, discharge, and conductivity have been collected approximately 250m downstream of the Highway 16 crossing as part of the Northern BC Hydrology Research project (station 08KA0002). These data are publicly accessible at https://bcgov-env.shinyapps.io/nbchydro/.

The habitat was rated as high value, with abundant spawning gravels and deep pools (&gt;1m) formed by functional large woody debris, providing high-quality overwintering habitat for fish of all ages. The average channel width was 19m, the average wetted width was 16.1m, and the average gradient was 0.7%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant. Downstream of the culvert, the stream ran parallel to the highway, with banks reinforced by riprap. Large wood, secured with metal wiring, was placed to create habitat and reduce flow, arranged in three sets of two logs spaced approximately 5m apart (Figure 5.39). These structures were likely installed to mitigate habitat loss caused by the riprapped banks. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199256 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199256 for 950m (Figure 5.38). The habitat was rated as high value, with gravels suitable for chinook and resident salmonid spawning. The stream was large and gravel-dominated, with extensive deep runs, deep pools, large woody debris, and multiple channels throughout. The riparian area was intact throughout, consisting of a mix of shrub-dominated wetland areas and mature mixed forest. The average channel width was 22.8m, the average wetted width was 16.7m, and the average gradient was 0.8%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with deep pools dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Highway 16 crossing (PSCIS 199256) with a bridge (24 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 18,000,000. Conclusion Kenneth Creek is a large, gravel-dominated stream with high-value habitat for salmonid spawning and rearing. Chinook and bull trout have been documented upstream of Highway 16 (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024), and a dead chinook spawner was observed upstream of the Highway 16 culvert during an informal site visit in 2022. bcfishpass modeling indicates nearly 50km of potential chinook spawning habitat upstream of Highway 16. The crossing had a significant outlet drop which may inhibit passage for younger life stages of salmonids. Furthermore, high water velocities in the culvert, as reported by Hooft (2006), likely further inhibit upstream passage at the crossing. Fish sampling (electroshocking or eDNA sampling) is recommended to determine which anadromous species and life stages are currently able to ascend past the crossing. Due to PSCIS crossing 199256 being located on highway 16, replacement of the crossing would be a large and expensive undertaking. Previous assessment by Hooft (2006) considered various mitigation options, including substrate placement, baffles, and downstream weirs, and concluded that replacement with a clear-spanning bridge or open-bottom structure is the only permanent solution to restore fish passage and address hydraulic concerns. The crossing is a high priority for replacement. Given the stream’s ecological value, restoration concerns outlined in AquaFor Consulting Ltd (1998) should be explored and the streams overlap with Sugarbowl–Grizzly Den Provincial Park could add additional conservation relevance. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.40: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 199256.

Comments: The culvert had a significant 1.4m outlet drop, and inlet drop due to a small debris jam. The stream flowed through mature old-growth forest and provided high-quality habitat with steep gradients, step pools, and cascade pools, suggesting the potential presence of bull trout. The highway crossing had a large amount of road fill, making construction difficult and expensive. The site would be a good candidate for replacement if feasible. The riparian area at the outlet had been cleared due to overhead powerlines.

The habitat was rated as high value, with gravels suitable for spawning and occasional pools ranging from 0.2 – 0.4m deep providing overwintering habitat. The stream flowed through a healthy, mature old-growth forest. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant.The average channel width was 7m, the average wetted width was 4.2m, and the average gradient was 5.3%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and boulders. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199260 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199260 for 650m (Figure 5.42). The habitat was rated as medium value, and appeared suitable for large bull trout spawning and rearing. The stream was a larger, steeper system with intact, mature coniferous cedar-hemlock riparian cover, primarily stable banks, and abundant large woody debris throughout. A step-pool morphology was present, characterized by pools up to 80cm deep and debris jam steps ranging from 30 – 60cm. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, boulders, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 6.1m, the average wetted width was 5.1m, and the average gradient was 7.1%. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Highway 16 crossing (199260) with a bridge (33 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 24,750,000. Conclusion PSCIS crossing 199260 had a substantial outlet drop and is a high priority for replacement. Average gradients were generally above the maximum thresholds for chinook spawning and rearing (4.5% and 5.5%, respectively), but fell within the suitable range for bull trout spawning and rearing (5.5% and 10.5%, respectively). The habitat upstream was rated as medium value for bull trout spawning and rearing, with bcfishpass modeling indicating ~900m of potential bull trout rearing habitat upstream of the crossing. Given the crossings location within Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Provincial Park and the park’s ecological significance, restoration efforts could align with broader conservation initiatives and public engagement, increasing the likelihood of funding and project momentum. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.44: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 199260.

The crossing is located 7.7km upstream of where Driscoll Creek joins the Fraser River. Situated on Highway 16, the crossing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1992674). This crossing is located on the boundary of the Chun T’oh Whudujut (Ancient Forest), a Provincial Park and Protected Area within the traditional territory of the Lheidli T’enneh (Figure 5.50). The park has thousand-year-old western red cedars and a rich biodiversity of plants, mosses, lichens and fungi which can be explored through the trail network. Historically, Lheidli people would visit the stands from summer fishing camps along the upper Fraser River as well as gather medicinal plants, some of which were thought to be extinct. However, the park was not always a protected area and was initially slated for logging until a UNBC graduate student studying lichen biodiversity identified the ancient stands of western red cedars. Recognizing their ecological and cultural significance, trails were developed to highlight the cedars and advocate for their protection. Through partnerships with local hiking groups, UNBC, Lheidli T’enneh, and the Provincial Government, the Ancient Forest biodiversity assessment project has contributed to conservation efforts and tourism-based economic development in the Prince George area (“Chun t’oh Whudujut (Ancient Forest)” 2025). my_caption &lt;- &quot;Map of Driscoll Creek&quot; knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/gis/map_driscoll.jpeg&quot;) Figure 5.43: Map of Driscoll Creek Background At PSCIS crossing 199267, Driscoll Creek is a fourth order stream and drains a high elevation watershed of approximately 34.3km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 1795m to 683m near the crossing (Table 5.45). In 2023, crossing 199267 on Highway 16 was assessed with a fish passage assessment and prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat and a historical chinook observation documented downstream in the FISS database (MoE 2024). A habitat confirmation assessment was subsequently conducted in 2024. Upstream of the Highway 16, rainbow trout and slimy sculpin have previously been recorded (Norris [2018] 2024; MoE 2024).

The habitat was rated as high value for spawning and rearing. The surrounding riparian area consisted of a healthy old-growth forest on both sides of the stream. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was gravels with fines sub-dominant.The average channel width was 10.7m, the average wetted width was 7.5m, and the average gradient was 0.6%.

Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199267 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199267 for 600m (Figures 5.44- 5.45). The habitat was rated as high value for spawning and rearing. The stream was a low-gradient, gravel-dominated system with an extensive shrub-sedge wetland area and beaver activity in the lower 200m. Deep pools up to 1m were present throughout, influenced by abundant large woody debris contributed from the adjacent mature, primarily coniferous forest. The dominant substrate was gravels with cobbles sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 8.9m, the average wetted width was 8.7m, and the average gradient was 0.5%. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Highway 16 crossing (199267) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 11,250,000. Conclusion PSCIS crossing 199267 on Highway 16 had a significant outlet drop and is a moderate priority for replacement. The habitat upstream of Highway 16 was rated as moderate value for spawning and rearing during the 2024 assessment, and fish sampling is recommended to further assess whether the crossing is inhibiting fish passage. Given the crossing’s proximity to Chun T’oh Whudujut (Ancient Forest) Provincial Park and its location within the traditional territory of the Lheidli T’enneh, restoration efforts could align with broader conservation initiatives and community engagement, increasing the likelihood of funding and project momentum. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.48: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 199267.

Crossing 199278 is located 2.4km upstream of the McLennan River, on Highway 5, and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 1467202). Approximately 300m upstream, PSCIS crossing 203302 is located on and is the responsibility of the CN Railway. The headwaters of Teepee Creek overlap with Mount Terry Fox Provincial Park, which commemorates Terry Fox for his outstanding achievements (“Mount Terry Fox Park” n.d.). Previously, access to the park was provided via the Mount Terry Fox Hiking Trail—a 16km out-and-back route gaining 1,740m in elevation on the hillside north of Teepee Creek, beginning near PSCIS crossing 4931 on Tinsley Pit Road (Caledonia Ramblers Hiking Club 2025). A newer trail now begins farther up the Teepee Creek drainage and follows the creek itself, connecting to a network of trails that can be used to access Mount Terry Fox with views of Mount Robson, as well as separate trails leading to alpine lakes and waterfalls. Additional information and downloadable GPX routes for the Teepee Creek trail are available here (Hike Valemount 2023). my_caption &lt;- &quot;Map of Teepee Creek&quot; knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/gis/map_teepee.jpeg&quot;) Figure 5.46: Map of Teepee Creek Background At PSCIS crossing 199278, Teepee Creek is a third order stream and drains a high elevation watershed of approximately 11km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 2648m to 798m near crossing 199278 (Table 5.49). Bull trout were captured upstream and downstream of crossing 199278 on Highway 5 by Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd. in 2004 (Manson 2005), and again near the crossing by Applied Aquatic Research Ltd. in 2006 (Applied Aquatic Research 2006). Additionally, a salmon observation from 2012 is documented upstream of Highway 5 in the FISS database (MoE 2024). In 2023, crossing 199278 was assessed with a fish passage assessment and prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat and known fish observation recorded upstream of the crossing as previously mentioned. A habitat confirmation assessment was subsequently conducted in 2024, encompassing crossing 199278 on Highway 5 as well as crossing 203302 located 300m upstream on the CN railway. Downstream of Highway 5 on the CN railway, PSCIS crossing 7620 was initially assessed in 2007, and upstream of the highway, PSCIS crossing 4931 was initially assessed by Cliff Jackman Contracting Ltd. in 2010 (MoE 2023).

Stream Characteristics at Crossings 199278 and 203302 During the 2023 and 2024 assessments, PSCIS crossing 199278 on Highway 5 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 5.51). The culvert had a moderate 0.4m outlet drop. First assessed in 2024, PSCIS crossing 203302 on the CN Railway was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 5.52). This culvert had a significant 0.75m outlet drop. In 2024, three other PSCIS crossings were assessed on Teepee Creek and can be found in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. Approximately 700m downstream of Highway 5, PSCIS crossing 7620 was located on the CN Railway (Figure 5.46). Although the crossing was ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011), the culvert was embedded, 100% backwatered, and was not a barrier to fish passage at the time of the survey. Roughly 70m downstream of Highway 5, there was a small bridge on private land (PSCIS 203300)(Figure 5.46). Approximately 600m upstream of PSCIS crossing 203302 on the CN Railway, PSCIS crossing 4931 was located on Mount Tinsley Pit Road, which falls under the road tenure of Carrier Lumber R13564 (Figure 5.46). The culvert had a significant 1.3m outlet drop.

Flow was steady at the time of assessment. The culvert was in good condition. A large, deep outlet pool indicated the culvert was likely undersized for the stream. Additionally, minimal road fill made this crossing a significant flood hazard, which could wash out Highway 5. Downstream, the stream had frequent pools 0.3-0.5m deep, providing good overwintering habitat for fish, and abundant gravels suitable for spawning. Roughly 150m downstream of the culvert, several cattle pens crossed the stream and appeared to be set up to provide cattle access for drinking. These areas were visibly trampled, with significant loss of riparian vegetation. Upstream, the stream was relatively confined, with only rare pockets of unembedded gravels. Deep pools were present, formed by boulder and large woody debris scour. A salmon point was noted near the pipeline location in FISS. Numerous small steps, ranging from 30-60cm, were present due to the steep, boulder-dominated nature of the stream. Electrofishing would be beneficial for further assessment. The site was a highway crossing, making replacement difficult. A small ford was located approximately 5m downstream of the culvert outlet.

The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 7.1m, the average wetted width was 4.5m, and the average gradient was 2.5%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation. Roughly 150m downstream of the culvert, several cattle pens crossed the stream and appeared to be set up to provide cattle access for drinking. These areas were visibly trampled, with significant loss of riparian vegetation. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199278 and Downstream of Crossing 203302 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199278 on Highway 5 to crossing 203302 on the CN Railway, a distance of approximately 300m (Figure 5.48). The habitat was rated as medium value for spawning and rearing, with frequent deep pools formed by boulders and large woody debris, but only limited pockets of unembedded gravels. Numerous small steps ranging from 30 – 60cm were present due to the steep, boulder-dominated nature of the stream. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 5.3m, the average wetted width was 3.3m, and the average gradient was 7.2%. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 203302 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 203302 for 600m (Figure 5.49). The habitat was rated as medium value for spawning and rearing, with few unembedded gravels; however, recent heavy rain caused slight turbidity making it difficult to assess the substrate. Total cover amount was rated as moderate with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as .The average channel width was 5.4m, the average wetted width was 3.9m, and the average gradient was 6.8%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant. Approximately 100m before the end of the site, the stream showed signs of a large disturbance event that had incised the channel to a depth of 1.2 – 2m, with major areas of aggregation where the channel was widened and uniform. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Highway 5 crossing (199278) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 11,250,000. Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Railway crossing (203302) with a bridge (15 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 11,250,000. Conclusion PSCIS crossing 199278 on Highway 5 had a moderate outlet drop that could be substantial at lower flows. A large, deep outlet pool indicated the culvert was likely undersized for the stream, and minimal road fill made this crossing a significant flood hazard which could wash out Highway 5, a major transportation route. The crossing is a high priority for replacement. A further 300m upstream, PSCIS crossing 203302 on the CN Railway had a substantial outlet drop, which may inhibit passage for younger life stages of salmonids. This crossing is a moderate priority for replacement. The documented fish observation recorded upstream of the Highway 5 crossing indicate that this stream has provided valuable fish habitat (Manson 2005; MoE 2024). Given the species present in the system and the outlet drops at both crossings, fish sampling is recommended to assess whether the culverts are impeding fish passage. Downstream of PSCIS crossing 199278 on Highway 5, heavy cattle activity has resulted in visibly trampled streambanks and significant loss of riparian vegetation. Additional signs of cattle disturbance were observed further downstream near PSCIS crossing 7620. This lower section of Teepee Creek presents an opportunity for riparian restoration to exclude cattle from the stream through measures such as fencing and the installation of offsite watering systems. Given the stream’s proximity to the Village of Valemount, landowner engagement through education and restoration initiatives should be explored. Furthermore, with Mount Terry Fox Provincial Park and the Teepee Creek trail network located upstream, crossing replacement and habitat restoration efforts could align with broader conservation goals and community initiatives, increasing the likelihood of funding and sustained project momentum. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site, my_site2)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings &quot;, my_site, &quot; and &quot;, my_site2, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.53: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossings 199278 and 203302.

The crossing is located 2.4km upstream of where Holliday Creek joins the Fraser River. Situated on Highway 16, the crossing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (chris_culvert_id: 29925). my_caption &lt;- &quot;Map of Holliday Creek&quot; knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/gis/map_holliday.jpeg&quot;) Figure 5.50: Map of Holliday Creek Background At PSCIS crossing 199282, Holliday Creek is a large, glaciated, fourth order stream that drains a high elevation watershed of approximately 55.2km2. The watershed ranges in elevation from a maximum of 2553m to 777m near the crossing (Table 5.54). In 2023, crossing 199282 was assessed with a fish passage assessment and prioritized for follow-up due to the presence of high-value habitat and a historical chinook salmon observation recorded downstream in the FISS database (MoE 2024). A habitat confirmation assessment was subsequently conducted in 2024. In 2004, chinook and bull trout were captured upstream and downstream of the Highway 16 crossing by Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd. (Manson 2005). Additionally, there is Fisheries and Oceans Canada stock assessment data available for Holliday Creek presented in Table 2.1 of the background section. Upstream of this crossing is the Holliday Creek Arch Protected Area, a small, 395-hectare protected area showcasing a 80m wide and 18m high natural stone arch (“Holliday Creek Arch Protected Area” n.d.). The park can be accessed via the Natural Arch Trail, which starts on Mt.Baker Mainline FSR near Highway 16 and climbs ~1000m to an alpine lookout (“Holliday Creek Arch Protected Area” n.d.). Outside of the park on the west side of the valley, the Groeneveld Trail also provides hiking access to beautiful views (Recreation Sites and Trails BC, n.d.).

Stream Characteristics at Crossing 199282 At the time of the 2024 assessment, PSCIS crossing 199282 on Highway 16 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011) (Table 5.56). The culvert had a significant 0.8m outlet drop and was undersized for the stream. The water temperature was 3\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.5 and conductivity was 162 uS/cm. # fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() # See issue https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/mybookdown-template/issues/65 fpr_table_cv_summary_memo_test() Table 5.56: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 199282.

Flow was high at the time of assessment, and at lower flows, the outlet drop would be even more substantial. Although the culvert was large, it was still likely undersized for the stream. The stream was a large glaciated system with a cobble-boulder substrate and an intact mixed riparian zone, primarily deciduous. Occasional large woody debris features created deep pool habitats and pockets of gravels were present suitable for spawning salmonids. A fish (~60mm) was observed during habitat confirmation.

The habitat was rated as high value with frequent gravels suitable for spawning and occasional pools available for overwintering. The average channel width was 16m, the average wetted width was 9.3m, and the average gradient was 2.8%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as boulders and undercut banks. Stream Characteristics Upstream of Crossing 199282 The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 199282 for 800m (Figure 5.52). The habitat was rated as medium value for spawning and rearing. Occasional large woody debris features created deep pools, with pockets of gravels suitable for spawning. The average channel width was 11.8m, the average wetted width was 8.9m, and the average gradient was 2.5%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as .The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of the Highway 16 crossing (PSCIS 199282) with a bridge (21 m span) is recommended. At the time of reporting in 2025, the cost of the work is estimated at $ 15,750,000. Conclusion Holliday Creek is a large, glaciated tributary to the Fraser River. Chinook and bull trout were captured both upstream and downstream of the PSCIS crossing 199282 in 2004, indicating this stream has provided valuable fish habitat (Manson 2005). Habitat modeling from bcfishpass identified 9km of potential bull trout spawning habitat upstream of the crossing, with no other barriers identified upstream of Highway 16. Given the documented species presence and available habitat upstream, fish sampling is recommended to assess whether the outlet drop is impeding fish passage. With the Holliday Creek Arch Protected Area and trails located upstream, crossing replacement could gain momentum as part of broader conservation and recreational initiatives. tab_hab_summary |&gt; dplyr::filter(Site %in% c(my_site)) |&gt; fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&quot;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &quot;, my_site, &quot;.&quot;), scroll = F) Table 5.57: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 199282.
